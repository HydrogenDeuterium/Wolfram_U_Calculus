00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 14 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好，欢迎来到本次与沃尔夫兰大学合作的微积分入门第14课。

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The topic for this lesson is related rates.
本节课的主题是相关率。

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson. In most problems, there will be
首先，我们先来简单介绍一下本课的内容。在大多数问题中，会有

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
more than one thing that is changing in relation to something else. For example,
不止一个事物，它与其他事物的关系正在发生变化。例如：

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you might have—of course time varies, but then two other things vary with time.
你可能会有--当然时间不同，但还有两样东西会随着时间而变化。

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As a good instance of that, let’s talk about a ladder that’s falling along a side of a wall.
作为一个很好的例子，让我们来谈谈一个沿着墙的一侧下降的梯子。

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That’s the ladder. It’s falling along the wall, and there are two things that are changing:
这就是梯子。沿着墙壁落下，有两样东西在变化。

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
there’s the height of the ladder from the top and the distance from the base of the ladder
梯子从上到下的高度和梯子从下到上的距离。

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to the base of the wall. Both of these are changing as the ladder falls.
到墙的底部。这两种情况都是随着梯子的下降而变化的。

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course, the rate at which the height is dropping and the rate at which
当然，高度下降的速度和

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the distance is increasing are related. That’s the theme for today’s lesson: related rates problems.
的距离越来越大是有关系的。这就是今天课程的主题：相关率问题。

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let’s begin with an example, and that’s exactly the one we talked about earlier on of the falling ladder,
我们先举一个例子，这正是我们前面说的那个坠梯的例子。

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but now we’ve got numbers in it. We have a ladder that’s 5 feet long, and it’s resting initially
但现在我们已经有了数字。我们有一个5英尺长的梯子，它最初是静止不动的

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
against a wall, and then it starts to slide down. Let’s say it slides down away from the wall
靠着墙，然后它开始下滑。比如说，它从墙上滑落下来

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
at a rate of 0.5 ft/s and the bottom of the ladder is 4 feet away from the wall at a certain point.
以0.5英尺/秒的速度，梯子底部距离墙面4英尺的某一点。

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The question is how fast is the ladder sliding down at that time instant? The first step
问题是当时梯子瞬间滑落的速度有多快？第一步

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in this case is to assign variables to whatever is changing in the problem. There are two things
在这种情况下，就是给问题中任何变化的东西分配变量。有两件事

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that are changing. There is the height—<i>y</i>, let’s say—and the distance <i>x</i>.
变化的。比如说，有高度<i>y</i>和距离<i>x</i>。

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Next I draw a picture of what’s happening. The picture is over here.
接下来，我画了一张图，把发生的事情画出来。图画在这里。

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That’s the distance of the base, that’s the height and that’s the actual ladder over here.
那是底座的距离，那是高度，那是这边的实际梯子。

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay. Now to find a relationship between <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and 5 over here, you recall
好了，现在要找到&lt; i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;、&lt; i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;和这边的5之间的关系。现在要找到<i>x</i>，<i>y</i>和5之间的关系，在这里，你记得

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the Pythagorean theorem from geometry, and that says that <i>x</i>^2 + <i>y</i>^2 = 5^2.
几何学中的毕达哥拉斯定理，说的是<i>x</i>^2+<i>y</i>^2=5^2。

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That’s the relationship that we require between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. Now because we want to find the rates,
这就是我们要求的<i>x</i>和<i>y</i>之间的关系。现在因为我们要找率。

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
we differentiate that relation with respect to <i>t</i>. What you get back is 2<i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>x</i>'[<i>t</i>] + 2<i>y</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>y</i>'[<i>t</i>] = 0.
我们对<i>t</i>的关系进行区分。你得到的是2<i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>x</i>'[<i>t<]。/i>]+2<i>y</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>y</i>'[<i>t</i>]=0。

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now keep in mind that <i>x</i> is 4 at that point, <i>x</i>' is 0.5, so you get back an equation which is
现在请记住，<i>x</i>在这一点上是4，<i>x</i>'是0.5，所以你得到的公式是

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
simpler than the earlier one, but it still ignored <i>y</i>’s. Then you recall the Pythagorean theorem,
比前面的更简单，但它仍然忽略了<i>y</i>的。然后你就会想起毕达哥拉斯定理。

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and that lets you find <i>y</i> as being 3. Once we’ve got <i>y</i>, we can plug that back in over here
这样你就可以找到<i>y</i>是3。一旦我们得到了<i>y</i>，我们就可以把它插回这里了

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
to the earlier equation—that’s this one—and you get back the rate of change of <i>y</i> as being −0.666667.
到前面的方程--也就是这个方程，你就可以得到<i>y</i>的变化率为-0.666667。

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 0.67 ft/sec approximately. The question is
梯子以大约0.67英尺/秒的速度从墙上滑落。问题是

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
why is that sign negative? Well, it’s negative because the top of the ladder is actually going down.
为什么是负号？负号是因为梯子的顶部实际上是向下的。

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Having solved that one problem, let’s set up a general strategy for solving such problems.
在解决了这一个问题之后，我们来建立一个解决这类问题的一般策略。

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
First, always try to understand the problem. Make sure you know what you are asked to do.
首先，一定要试着去了解问题。确保你知道要求你做什么。

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Next, assign symbols to all variables—<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, et cetera—in the problem.
接下来，给问题中的所有变量--< i>x</i>，< i>y</i>，等等分配符号。

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now to help yourself understand the problem better, draw a picture. It doesn’t have to be very elegant,
现在为了帮助自己更好地理解这个问题，画一张图。不一定要很优雅。

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
but it should be just enough for you to understand what you need to do. Next, the creative part:
但应该刚好够你了解你需要做什么。接下来，是创意部分。

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
find an equation that relates all the variables in the problem. Usually something from geometry
找到一个方程，将问题中的所有变量联系起来。通常是几何学上的东西

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
is going to help you to do that. Next differentiate the equation with respect to time using the chain rule.
就是要帮你做到这一点。接下来用链式法则对方程进行关于时间的微分。

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That’s the key rule for today’s lesson. Now you already know a few variables,
这就是今天课程的关键规则。现在你已经知道了几个变量。

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but you need to find any remaining unknown variables before you proceed. Once you have done that,
但你需要在继续之前找到任何剩余的未知变量。一旦你完成了这些工作，

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
then you substitute all the information that you’ve found out and solve for the true
然后，你把你找到的所有信息代入，并解出真正的。

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
unknown quantity in the problem. That’s the general strategy for this lesson.
问题中的未知量。这就是本节课的总体策略。

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let’s try and apply it to a few more problems. Here you have a spherical balloon
让我们试着把它应用到一些更多的问题上。这里你有一个球形的气球

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that’s being filled at a rate of 50 cm^3/sec. The question is find the rate at which
以50 cm^3/秒的速度填充。问题是找出

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the radius is increasing when the diameter is 25 cm. Now in this case, the volume and the radius
当直径为25厘米时，半径越来越大。现在，在这种情况下，体积和半径为

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
are both functions of time. Here’s a picture. It has the radius and the volume as being
都是时间的函数。这里有一张图片。它的半径和体积都是：

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
the variables for the problem. Next, you know from geometry that the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π<i>r</i>^3,
问题的变量。接下来，你从几何学中知道，球体的体积是(4/3)π<i>r</i>^3。

47
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
so that’s the relation. Next you differentiate that relation, and you get back an equation
所以这就是关系。接下来你对这个关系进行微分，就会得到一个方程。

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:12,000
relating <i>v</I>', <i>r</i> and <i>r</i>'. Of course you need to find what <i>r</i> is at that time <i>t</i>, but you know the diameter
有关<i>v</I>'，<i>r</i>和<i>r</i>'。当然你需要找到当时<i>r</i>是什么<i>t</i>，但你知道直径为

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
is twice the radius and the diameter is 25, so the radius at that time is 12.5.
是半径的2倍，直径是25，所以当时的半径是12.5。

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You plug back all the information that’s known to you, and you find that
你把所有已知的信息都插回去，然后你会发现

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:35,000
the radius is increasing at roughly 0.025 cm/sec.
半径大约以0.025厘米/秒的速度增加。

52
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
For the third problem, let’s talk about a watchdog. There is a cat that is walking down a street
第三个问题，我们来说说看家狗。有一只猫，它正走在一条大街上

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
at 3 feet per second. Now, a dog is sitting and sees this cat and stays focused on it.
以每秒3英尺的速度。现在，一只狗正坐在那里，看到这只猫，并一直关注着它。

54
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It doesn’t actually move, but then the dog is known to be 6 feet from the street
其实它并没有动，但后来知道狗是六尺见方的。

55
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and the cat is 8 feet from that point. The question is how fast is the dog’s head turning?
而猫距离该点有8英尺。问题是狗的头转得有多快？

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There are two things that are changing: the dog’s head is turning and the cat is moving away.
有两件事正在发生变化：狗头在转，猫在走。

57
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The question is what do you do over here? Well, you first draw a picture.
问题是你在这里做什么？嗯，你先画一幅画。

58
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That’s the angle of turning of the dog’s head, that’s the distance traveled by the cat down the street
那是狗头转动的角度，那是猫在街上走过的距离。

59
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and this distance over here is given to us to be 6 feet. Now in this case
这里的距离是6英尺。现在在这种情况下

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
we have a right-angle triangle, so we can use the tangent of θ as the function <i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]/6.
我们有一个直角三角形，所以我们可以用θ的切线作为函数<i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]/6。

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Once we have the relation over here, then you can differentiate it and you find that
当我们有了这边的关系之后，那么你就可以把它区分开来，你就会发现。

62
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you have another relation for θ' now, but now you need to know what the secant of θ is.
你现在有了θ的另一个关系，但现在你需要知道θ的分词是什么。

63
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Well, the point is that you have the Pythagorean theorem, so you use that to work out
重点是你有毕达哥拉斯定理，所以你用它来计算出：

64
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the hypotenuse of the triangle at that time. It turns out to be 10. Use that to find the secant
当时三角形的斜边。结果是10。用它来求正割

65
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
like we’ve done over here. Once we’ve done that, you can plug in all the values
就像我们在这里做的那样。一旦我们做了这些，你就可以插入所有的值

66
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and work out the rate at which the dog’s head is turning.
并计算出狗头转动的速度。

67
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The dog’s head is rotating at 9/50 radians/sec or about 10.313 degrees/sec.
狗头以9/50弧度/秒的速度旋转，即约10.313度/秒。

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay. On to the final problem for the lesson. Oil is being poured into an inverted cone
好了，现在进入本课的最后一道题。到了本课的最后一道题。油被倒入一个倒置的圆锥体中。

69
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,000
at a rate of 3 m^3/sec. That’s the rate of change of the volume. Given that the cone’s height is 10 m
以3米^3/秒的速度。这就是体积的变化率。考虑到圆锥体的高度是10米。

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and the radius is 5 m, the question is find the rate at which the oil level is rising
且半径为5米，问题是求油位上升的速度。

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:14,000
when the oil is 5 m deep. You’ve got two variables over here: the volume and the height.
当油深5米时这里有两个变量：体积和高度。

72
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That’s the picture for the problem. Now, you know from geometry that the volume of a cone
这就是这个问题的图片。现在，你从几何学上知道，一个圆锥的体积。

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is given by (1/3)π<i>r</i>^2<i>h</i>, so that’s the equation for the problem.
由(1/3)π< i>r</i>^2< i>h</i>给出，所以这就是问题的方程。

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Notice that you in fact have <i>v</i>, <i>h</i> and <i>r</i>, and in fact you want to work only with <i>v</i> and <i>h</i>,
请注意，您实际上有<i>v</i>、<i>h</i>和<i>r</i>，实际上您只想用<i>v</i>和<i>h</i>工作。

75
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so we need to do a bit more work. Recall that when you studied similar triangles,
所以我们需要再做一些工作。记得在学习类似三角形的时候。

76
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
then you could find a relationship between the base and height. In this case,
那么你就可以找到底座和高度之间的关系。在这种情况下。

77
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the radius is going to be half the height in the oil tank because by similarity,
半径要比油箱里的高度低一半，因为通过相似性。

78
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
any cone in the tank has a radius equal to half the height because you have the initial ones
罐中的任何锥体的半径都等于高度的一半，因为你有初始的锥体。

79
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and the same ratio. Here’s the volume equation with that relationship.
和相同的比例。这是有这种关系的体积公式。

80
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You differentiate it and plug in values, and you find that oil level is rising at 12/25π m/s.
你把它区分开来，插上数值，你发现油位以12/25π米/秒的速度上升。

81
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of the lesson, but our main objective over here
好了，我的课就到此结束了。这使我到了本课的最后，但我们的主要目标在这里。

82
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
was to solve problems which involved related rates. What we did was we set up
是为了解决涉及相关费率的问题。我们所做的是我们建立了

83
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a general strategy for these problems. Then we solved a few of them, but in each case,
这些问题的一般策略。然后我们解决了其中的几个问题，但在每一个问题上。

84
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
what you need to do is to use the given information and then apply some geometry
你需要做的是使用给定的信息，然后应用一些几何图形

85
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,000
typically to get the equations required for the problem. That’s the end of this topic.
一般是为了得到问题所需的方程。这个题目就到此为止了。

86
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about linear approximations, but before we do that,
在下一节课中，我们会讲到线性近似，但在这之前。

87
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
do review this lesson. This was a pretty advanced application of calculus.
做复习这节课。这是一节相当高级的微积分应用课。

88
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It’s just that we now know calculus so well that we can apply things quite easily,
只是我们现在对微积分了解得很透彻，可以很容易地应用一些东西。

89
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but do review this lesson, look at the exercises and you should be ready for the next one
但是，复习一下这节课，看看练习，你应该为下一节课做好准备。

90
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
on linear approximations. I’ll stop over here. Thank you.
关于线性近似。我在这里停一下谢谢你了
