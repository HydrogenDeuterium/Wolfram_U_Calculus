00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 17 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好，欢迎来到本次与沃尔夫兰大学合作的微积分入门第17课。

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is the mean value theorem.
本节课的课题是均值定理。

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson. The mean value theorem, roughly speaking,
先来简单介绍一下本课的内容。均值定理，粗略的说。

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
relates to the slope of an interval with the instantaneous slope of some point in that interval.
关系到一个区间的斜率与该区间内某点的瞬时斜率。

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now let’s look at that a little bit more in detail. Here you’ve got a curve,
现在让我们来看看更详细一点的情况。这里你已经得到了一条曲线。

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and I joined the two endpoints over here by a secant. What the theorem is saying is that
我把这两个端点连接在一起，用了一个分词。该定理的意思是

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the slope of this interval over here is somehow related to the slope of this tangent at some point.
这边的这个区间的斜率与这个切线的斜率在某一点上有某种关系。

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That’s what the theorem is about, about the slopes of intervals and the slopes of tangents.
这就是定理的内容，关于区间的斜率和切线的斜率。

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The goal of this lesson is to first of all understand the mean value theorem
本节课的目标是首先理解均值定理。

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and then give a few applications of the theorem. We’ll begin with
然后给出该定理的一些应用。我们先说说

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
a special case of the theorem called Rolle’s theorem.
该定理的一种特殊情况，称为罗尔定理。

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
As a motivation for Rolle’s theorem, let’s look at the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2.
作为罗尔定理的动机，我们来看一下函数<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]=<i>x</i>^2。

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here is a plot of the function as a parabola. Notice that the value of the function
下面是函数的抛物线图。请注意，函数的值

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,000
at the two endpoints −2 and 2 is the same, and the slope at 0, the derivative, is 0.
在两个端点-2和2处是相同的，在0处的斜率，即导数，是0。

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That’s the hint for Rolle’s theorem, that the slope is 0 at the top, and you also have a tangent,
这就是罗尔定理的提示，斜率在顶部为0，你也有一个切线。

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
so to speak, at which the slope is 0. Now a more formal statement of Rolle’s theorem,
可以这么说，在该处的斜率为0.现在对罗尔定理进行更正式的陈述。

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
which was proved by Michel Rolle. What it says is that if you have a function
这是由Michel Rolle证明的。它说的是，如果你有一个函数

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that satisfies three hypotheses—first of all, it is continuous on a certain closed interval;
，满足三个假设--首先，它在某个闭区间上是连续的。

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
it is differentiable on an open interval; and the value of the function at the left endpoint
它在开区间上是可微分的；并且函数在左端点的值为

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is the same as the value at the right endpoint—then there is a number <i>c</i>
与右端点的值相同，则有一个数字<i>c</i>。

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in the interval at which the derivative becomes 0. The previous function we talked about in fact
在导数变为0的区间内，我们前面谈到的函数其实是

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
satisfies all the three hypotheses. After all, you do have a continuous function,
满足所有三个假设。毕竟，你确实有一个连续函数。

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it’s differentiable and the values at both the end points are the same.
它是可微分的，而且两端点的值是一样的。

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Here’s a plot which just confirms the theorem and says that the slope of this secant line
这里有一张图，正好证实了这个定理，并说这条秒线的斜率为

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
is the same as the slope of that tangent over there, which is 0.
与那边的那个切线的斜率相同，即为0。

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay. Now on to the problems with Rolle’s theorem and how you apply it.
好了，现在说说罗尔定理的问题以及如何应用。现在说说罗尔定理的问题，以及你如何应用它。

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:17,000
First of all, let’s look at 1/<i>x</i>^2 on the interval (−1, 1). Notice that it has a discontinuity at 0,
首先，我们看一下区间（-1，1）上的1/<i>x</i>^2。注意它在0处有一个不连续的地方。

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so of course it’s not differentiable over there as well.
所以当然在那边也是无法区分的。

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The values at the endpoints are certainly equal; however, it does not satisfy all the hypotheses
端点的数值肯定是相等的；但是，它并不满足所有的假说

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
of Rolle’s theorem, and hence we cannot guarantee that there is any number in this range
的Rolle定理，因此我们不能保证在这个范围内有任何数量的

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
at which the slope is 0. In fact, we confirm that using Solve, and we check that the derivative
事实上，我们使用Solve确认了这一点，并且我们检查了导数

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is never 0 in this interval.
在这个区间内永远不会是0。

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
As another issue with the theorem, let’s look at the absolute value function between −1 and 1.
作为该定理的另一个问题，我们来看看-1和1之间的绝对值函数。

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Clearly that is continuous, but it is not differentiable at <i>x</i> = 0. There’s a corner at <i>x</i> = 0.
显然这是连续的，但在<i>x</i>=0时是不可微分的，在<i>x</i>=0时有一个角。

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The value of the function at both endpoints is the same, but since it does not satisfy
两端点的函数值是一样的，但由于不满足

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
all the hypotheses of Rolle’s theorem—therefore you cannot guarantee that there is a number
罗尔定理的所有假设--因此，你不能保证有一个数量的

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
at which the slope is 0. Once again, you can use Solve to confirm that there is no such value.
再一次，你可以使用Solve来确认是否有这样的值。

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That’s the derivative of the absolute value function on the interval, and it’s never 0 on that interval.
那是绝对值函数在区间上的导数，在这个区间上它永远不会是0。

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay. Now on to the mean value theorem and some motivation. In the earlier example,
好了，现在说说均值定理和一些动机。现在说说均值定理和一些动机。在前面的例子中。

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we said that the secant line between −2 and 2 and the tangent line at 0 had the same slope.
我们说，-2和2之间的秒线和0处的切线有相同的斜率。

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now the whole situation over here is very symmetrical, so what we’ll do is we’ll make it
现在，整个情况在这里是非常对称的， 所以我们要做的是，我们将使其

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
slightly less symmetrical by looking at the interval [−0.5, 1]. That’s the interval over here.
通过观察[-0.5，1]这个区间，稍微不那么对称。这就是这边的区间。

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now we notice that the secant line at <i>x</i> = −0.5 and <i>x</i> = 1, the line joining those two points,
现在我们注意到，在<i>x</i>=-0.5和<i>x</i>=1处的秒线，是连接这两点的线。

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:21,000
has got a slope 1/2. We can calculate that. The same thing happens at <i>x</i> = 1/4—namely, the tangent line
有一个1/2的斜率。我们可以计算出来。同样的情况也发生在<i>x</i>=1/4处--也就是说，切线为

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
at that point has a slope of 1/2. The mean value theorem is just a modification,
在该点的斜率为1/2。均值定理只是一种修改。

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
a more general version of Rolle’s theorem. Here is a formal statement of the theorem which says that
罗尔定理的一个更一般的版本。这里是对该定理的正式陈述，它表示

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
suppose you have a function <i>f</i> that is continuous on a closed interval, differentiable on
假设你有一个函数<i>f</i>，它在一个闭区间上是连续的，可在

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the open interval in that case. Then there is a number <i>c</i> in the interval at which
在这种情况下的开放区间。那么在该区间内有一个数字<i>c</i>，在该区间的

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the slope of the tangent line equals the slope of the secant line joining the endpoints.
切线的斜率等于连接端点的割线的斜率。

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:17,000
More formally, <i>f</i>'(<i>c</i>) = (<i>f</i>(<i>b</i>) − <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>))/(<i>b</i> − <i>a</i>). Sometimes it’s easier to cross-multiply and get
更正式地说，<i>f</i>'(<i>c</i>)=(<i>f</i>(<i>b</i>)-<i>f</i>(<i>a</i>))/(<i>b</i>-<i>a</i>)。有时交叉相乘会更容易得到

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
the same equation in a slightly different form like is done over here. Now of course,
同样的等式在一个稍微不同的形式，就像在这里做的一样。现在，当然。

52
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Rolle’s theorem follows from the mean value theorem because if you set <i>f</i>[<i>b</i>] equal to <i>f</i>[<i>a</i>],
罗尔定理从均值定理出发，因为如果设<i>f</i>[<i>b</i>]等于<i>f</i>[<i>a</i>]。

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
then you have <i>f</i>'[<i>c</i>] equal to 0 at the point <i>c</i>.
那么在点<i>c</i>处，你有<i>f</i>'[<i>c</i>]等于0。

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That’s the Rolle’s theorem for the sine function on the interval [0, π].
这就是区间[0，π]上正弦函数的罗尔定理。

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There are some issues with the mean value theorem I have interpreted.
我所解释的均值定理存在一些问题。

56
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
For example, we could have more than one <i>c</i>, which satisfies the theorem. Here you have a curve
例如，我们可以有一个以上的<i>c</i>，它满足定理。这里你有一条曲线

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
in which that’s the secant line and those two tangents have the same slope as the secant line.
其中，那是正切线，而这两条切线的斜率与正切线相同。

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In fact, if you have a constant function like <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = 5, then the slope is 0 everywhere.
事实上，如果你有一个像<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]=5这样的常数函数，那么斜率到处都是0。

59
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Here’s the constant function 5, and if you plot the function derivative, you see that
这里是常数函数5，如果你绘制函数导数，你会看到

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the theorem is satisfied everywhere. You have some exceptions with the mean value theorem
该定理处处满足。你的均值定理有一些例外情况

61
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
when you have either more than one value, or you might even have infinitely many values
当你有一个以上的值，或者你甚至可能有无限多的值的时候

62
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
because if the slope happens to be 0, then the function must be constant.
因为如果斜率刚好为0，那么函数一定是常数。

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay. With that, some applications. For the first application, let’s look at the function <i>x</i>^3 − 8<i>x</i>
好吧，有了这个，一些应用。就这样，一些应用。第一个应用，让我们看看函数<i>x</i>^3 - 8<i>x</i>。

64
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
on the interval 0 to 4, and you want to find a <i>c</i> in the range which has a tangent line
在0到4的区间上，你想在这个范围内找到一个有切线的<i>c</i>。

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
parallel to the secant line to the endpoints. For the first step, you know that the mean value theorem
平行于secant线的端点。对于第一步，你知道均值定理。

66
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
is certainly applicable because you have a polynomial function. You solve for <i>c</i> or <i>x</i>
当然是适用的，因为你有一个多项式函数。你要解<i>c</i>或<i>x</i>。

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
like this equation, and the value of <i>c</i> or <i>x</i> is the value of 4/√3. At that value of <i>x</i>,
像这个方程，而<i>c</i>或<i>x</i>的值是4/√3的值。在该值为<i>x</i>时．

68
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
we actually have a tangent line that is parallel to the secant line through the two endpoints.
其实我们有一条切线，通过两个端点平行于secant线。

69
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now let’s check that with the tangent line and a plot of the curve and tangent,
现在我们用切线和曲线和切线的图来检验一下。

70
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and you can see that the secant line over here has the same slope as the tangent line over there.
你可以看到这边的正切线和那边的切线有相同的斜率。

71
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay. As another example of the mean value theorem, let’s talk about a function <i>f</i>
好吧，那就再举一个均值定理的例子吧。作为均值定理的另一个例子，我们来谈谈函数<i>f</i>。

72
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
whose value at 0 is 4 and whose derivative is bounded above by 6, and the question is how large
其在0处的值是4，其导数在上面的边界是6，问题是多大的

73
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
can the value of <i>f</i> at 3 possibly be? Because <i>f</i> is differentiable, therefore clearly it is continuous,
3处的<i>f</i>的值可能是多少？因为<i>f</i>是可微分的，所以显然它是连续的。

74
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and so what we’ll do is we’ll apply the mean value theorem on the interval [0, 3].
所以我们要做的就是在区间[0，3]上应用均值定理。

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The mean value theorem says that you have the equation <i>f</i>(3) − <i>f</i>(0) is the value of the derivative
平均值定理说，你有公式<i>f</i>(3)-<i>f</i>(0)是导数的值。

76
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:27,000
at that point <i>c</i> times (3 − 0). You have a <i>c</i> with that property. Because you have <i>f</i>' less than
在这一点上<i>c</i>乘以(3 - 0).你有一个&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;具有该属性。你有一个<i>c</i>的属性。因为你的<i>f</i>'小于

77
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
or equal to 6, therefore you set up the equation, which is <i>f</i>'[<i>c</i>], to be at most 6 and solve it for <i>f</i>[<i>3</i>],
或等于6，因此你设方程，即<i>f</i>'[<i>c</i>]，最多为6，解得<i>f</i>[<i>3</i>]。

78
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and you find that the value of <i>f</i>[3] can be at the most 22.
并且你发现<i>f</i>[3]的值最多可以是22。

79
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay. As another example, let’s try and show that this polynomial, <i>x</i>^3 + 8<i>x</i> − 2, has exactly one root.
好吧，再举个例子。作为另一个例子，让我们试着证明这个多项式，<i>x</i>^3 + 8<i>x</i> - 2，正好有一个根。

80
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because the function is continuous, you can apply the intermediate value theorem to try and show
因为函数是连续的，你可以应用中间值定理来尝试并证明

81
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:12,000
that a root exists. The point is that the value of <i>f</i> at 0 is negative and the value at 1 is positive,
即存在一个根。关键是<i>f</i>在0处的值为负，在1处的值为正。

82
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
so the function must take every value between those two values, so at some point or the other,
所以函数必须取这两个值之间的每一个值，所以在某些时候或其他时候。

83
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
it must become 0, so you certainly have a root in the interval 0 to 1.
它一定会变成0，所以你肯定在0到1的区间内有一个根。

84
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now let’s suppose there are two roots, <i>a</I> and <i>b</i>. Then the mean value theorem would say
现在我们假设有两个根，<i>a</I>和<i>b</i>。那么均值定理就会说

85
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
that you actually have a slope of 0 between them, and hence you have a point <i>c</i>
在它们之间实际上有一个0的斜率，因此你有一个点<i>c</i>。

86
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
for which the slope is 0 as well. Then if we look at the derivative, it’s 3<i>x</i>^2 + 8,
对其斜率也是0。那么如果我们看一下导数，就是3<i>x</i>^2+8。

87
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
which can never be 0, so it’s clear that you only have one root,
永远不可能是0，所以很明显，你只有一个根。

88
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but let’s just plot the function and make sure. You see over here that the function
但我们还是把函数画出来，确定一下。你看这里，函数

89
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
becomes zero somewhere to the right of 0, but then never again.
在0的右边某处变成零，但以后再也不会了。

90
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Now as an amusing application of the mean value theorem, let’s talk about speed limits.
现在作为均值定理的一个有趣的应用，我们来谈谈限速问题。

91
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Suppose you’ve got two points, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, on a road, and they are 90 miles apart.
假设你有两个点，<i>A</i>和<i>B</i>，在一条路上，它们相距90英里。

92
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You start from point <i>A</i> at noon. Suppose you don’t take any breaks in your journey,
你在中午时分从点<i>A</i>出发。假设你在旅途中没有任何休息。

93
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and you get to the point <i>B</i> at 1 o’clock. Now, the speed limit in that area says that
而你在一点钟方向到达B点<i>B</i>。现在，该地区的限速规定是：

94
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
you cannot exceed 80 miles per hour. The question is should you receive a speeding ticket or not?
你不能超过80英里每小时。问题是你到底该不该收到超速罚单？

95
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, here’s the average speed for the whole trip. It’s 90. If you apply the mean value theorem,
嗯，这是整个行程的平均速度。是90公里如果你应用平均值定理， If you apply the mean value theorem,

96
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
at some point, you must surely have crossed the speed limit of 80 miles per hour,
在某些时候，你肯定已经超过了时速80英里的限制。

97
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
so certainly you should receive a speeding ticket, and it’s going to cost you some money.
所以你肯定要收到一张超速罚单，而且要花你一些钱。

98
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay. Let’s summarize the lesson for today. We saw that the mean value theorem relates
好了，我们来总结一下今天的课程。我们来总结一下今天的课程。我们看到均值定理涉及到了

99
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the average slope of an interval with the instantaneous slope in the interval. Basically it says that
区间的平均斜率与区间的瞬时斜率。基本上是说

100
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
you’ve got a point at which the average slope is the same as the instantaneous slope.
你已经得到了一个点，平均斜率与瞬时斜率相同。

101
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Of course this theorem is a very useful theorem. We saw some applications,
当然这个定理是一个非常有用的定理。我们看到了一些应用。

102
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but in the next lesson, we’ll see even more where we’ll talk about the graphs of functions.
但在下一节课，我们会看到更多的地方，我们将讨论函数的图形。

103
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That’s really a very interesting geometrical problem which gets solved nicely
这真是一个非常有趣的几何问题，它得到了很好的解决。

104
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
with the use of the mean value theorem and other properties of derivatives.
与利用均值定理和导数的其他性质。

105
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But before we do that, do look over today’s lesson, do review the exercises
但在这之前，请看一下今天的课程，请复习一下习题

106
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and be ready for the lesson on graphs of functions. I’ll stop over here. Thank you.
并准备好函数图的课程。我在这里停一下谢谢你了
