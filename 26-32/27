Hello, and welcome to Lesson 27 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好，这里是 Wolfram U的微积分入门，第27课

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic of this lesson is the substitution rule.
本次课程的主题是  不定积分

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.
先简单回顾一下上节课

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the last lesson, we talked about

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
some rules for calculating integrals,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we learned a few simple rules.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For example, we can now do the integral of <i>x</i>^2 and get back <i>x</i>^3/3,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so that’s <i>x</i>^<i>a</i> giving you <i>x</i>^(<i>a</i> + 1)/(<i>a</i> + 1), the power rule.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The rules we learned cannot help us in more difficult cases.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For example, if I gave you the function 10Sin[3<i>x</i>],

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then those rules would not work, and they will not work

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
for this harder problem involving a square root radical.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here are the functions and their plots.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What you notice is that these are quite interesting functions,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
so surely you would like to integrate them.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The question is how do we do that,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and that is the goal of this lesson.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The goal of this lesson is to try and calculate such integrals

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
using what is called the substitution rule.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But to do that, I must recall the chain rule for you.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The chain rule says that if you have two functions, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>—

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so you have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]—then the derivative of the composition

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] is <i>f</i>'[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] * <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>].

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Here’s the rule a little more formally using D,

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and you get back the answer that you expected.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now of course, every time you have

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
a rule for derivatives like this one,

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
then you have a rule for integration, so now that says that

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the integral of <i>f</i>'[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] * <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>] is <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]],

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and that is the basis for the substitution rule.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let’s go a little deeper and talk about the substitution rule.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let’s say you want to evaluate this integral over here.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What we’ll do is to simplify things, we’ll set <i>u</i> to be <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now you get <i>f</i>'[<i>u</i>], and you’ll get this <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But then if you think about it, the derivative of <i>u</i> is <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>],

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so that says that roughly speaking, <i>du</i> = <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That’s a differential statement, but it’s correct.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Basically what we’ve done is

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to reduce this rather difficult-looking integral on the left

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to a rather simple-looking integral on the right,

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and that is the substitution rule for integrals.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For example, if I said find the integral of 3Sin[3<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>,

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
then you set <i>u</i> to be 3<i>x</i>.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So <i>du</i> is 3<i>dx</i> because that’s the derivative of 3<i>x</i>.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That 3 over here and the <i>dx</i> over there combine, and you get Sin[<i>u</i>]<i>du</i>.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then we can’t stop over here because <i>u</i> is 3<i>x</i>,

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
so the answer is –Cos[3<i>x</i>].

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can check that directly with Integrate,

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and you do get back the right answer.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That’s the rule for substitution,

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
namely, you set <i>u</i> to be <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>] and then proceed from there.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
As an example, let’s take another trig function, 10Sin[3<i>x</i>].

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Again, you set <i>u</i> to be 3<i>x</i>, so <i>du</i> is 3<i>dx</i>.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But then you have a 10 over here, so you make a small adjustment

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and write it as (10/3) * 3, and so you get back that

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the integral really is (10/3)Sin[<i>u</i>].

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You integrate that, but then recall that <i>u</i> is 3<i>x</i>,

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so you plug that back in and you get back the exact answer,

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
which is what Integrate would give you if you tried it directly.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay. Let’s go a step further now

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and talk about an algebraic function.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That’s the second function from the introduction.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here you think of this inside the square root sign as being <i>u</i>,

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
so <i>u</i> is <i>x</i>^3 + 3.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So <i>du</i> = 3<i>x</i>^2<i>dx</i> because that’s the derivative of 3<i>x</i>^3 + 3,

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but then you think to yourself you’ve got a 2 over here,

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
so we need a small adjustment.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We’ll add to this 2/3 * 3, so you have that

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the integral is 2/3√<i>u</i> with respect to <i>u</i>.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You plug in the expression for <i>u</i>

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and you get back the answer in terms of <i>x</i>,

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and of course Integrate gives just the same answer in this case.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let’s now go on to a slightly harder example

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
where you have a kind of rational algebraic function.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Here you set <i>u</i> to be 5 – 5<i>x</i>^2,

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
so <i>du</i> is –10<i>xdx</i> because that’s the derivative of <i>u</i>.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then you tell yourself that you have a 2<i>x</i> over here,

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
so we need a small adjustment, so that is (–2/10) *  –10,

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and you get back the integral of <i>u</i> over here.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You plug in the expression for <i>u</i> as 5 – 5<i>x</i>^2,

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and of course integrate will give you back

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
just the same answer in this case.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay. Slightly harder example: you have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^3√(3 – <i>x</i>^2).

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You set <i>u</i> to be 3 – <i>x</i>^2.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That’s what’s inside the square root sign.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So <i>du</i> is –2<i>xdx</i>.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Now another problem: you need to integrate the <i>x</i>^3 carefully

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
as the –2<i>x</i> bit from here and the part that’s left over,

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
which is <i>x</i>^2, but <i>x</i>^2 is just 3 – <i>u</i>,

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and that’s how I get the part over here.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The integral becomes (–1/2)(3 – <i>u</i>)√<i>u</i>.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You integrate that.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You plug in the expression, and of course Integrate will give you

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
just the same answer in this case as well.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, there’s a slight difference because you have

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
a negative sign inside over here and outside,

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
but essentially they are the same answer.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now the point is that you have two answers,

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
one in terms of <i>u</i> and the other in terms of <i>x</i>.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
As far as this example goes, it’s the <i>x</i> answer that matters,

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
but when you go on to definite integrals,

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
then you want to actually plug in limits, and at that point,

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
we have two ways of going about it.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
First of all, what you could do is

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you could work with the expression involving <i>x</i>, the <i>x</i> answer,

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and plug in the upper and lower limits.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let’s say you want to go from 0 to 1.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You plug in the value of the <i>x</i> answer at 1 and then at 0,

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and you get back the answer over here.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But you could also keep the <i>u</i> form, and if you do that,

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you’ve got to be careful because when <i>x</i> goes from 0 to 1,

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
then <i>u</i> goes from 3 to 2.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That’s because <i>u</i> is defined in terms of <i>x</i>.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Here’s the answer again from the <i>u</i> method,

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and you get back just the same result.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can check it all with Integrate, and you have

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the first answer is the <i>u</i> answer going from 3 to 2.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The other one is from 0 to 1 for <i>x</i>,

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and you get back the same result in both the cases.

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The point is that when you have a definite integral,

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
then you could either work in the <i>u</i> picture or the <i>x</i> picture,

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and they are both convenient in some ways.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The <i>u</i> answer tends to be simpler,

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but you need to change the limits.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The <i>x</i> answer tends to be more complicated,

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
but then you have the limits given to you.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You should decide which one is better in each case.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The main point is the substitution rule lets you

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
calculate integrals using the chain rule in reverse.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This rule is essentially a reverse chain rule.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What you do is you always begin by making a substitution <i>u</i>,

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
a suitable one.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then you find <i>du</i> and modify the integral as required.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Then you plug back the expression for <i>u</i> after integrating

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and you get back the result.

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But of course when working with definite integrals,

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you could either work with the original endpoints and <i>x</i>,

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
or change the endpoints and work with <i>u</i>.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That’s the essence of this rule.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In the next lesson, we’ll apply these ideas

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to compute the area between two curves.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But before doing that, do review the lesson.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It’s quite a difficult lesson because you’ll need this rule

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
again and again, and you must have some practice with applying it.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
