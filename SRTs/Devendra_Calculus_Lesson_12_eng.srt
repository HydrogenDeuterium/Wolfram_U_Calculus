00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 12 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic of this lesson is implicit differentiation.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the topic. So far, all of the functions that we have considered

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
are in so-called explicit form. For example, here is a function <i>f</i> which is defined to be <i>x</i>^2 – <i>x</i> + 1.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Every time I give you a value of <i>x</i>, you could work out the value of <i>f</i> at that <i>x</i>.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That’s an explicit function, but sometimes you have a function that’s defined only implicitly.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For example, here’s an equation <i>x</i>^2 + <i>y</i>^2 = 4, and surely <i>y</i> is a function of <i>x</i>—it depends on <i>x</i>—

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but it does so in an indirect implicit way. Now of course in this case, you could solve the equation

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and work out <i>y</i> in terms of <i>x</i> and you get back two solutions, so really, you have two functions of <i>x</i>,

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and then you could plot them. What you see is that you have a circle,

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and the first solution is the bottom of the circle and the second solution is the top half,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
so that’s of course why you need two functions rather than one to describe the problem.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That’s solution of an implicit function, and today is what we will do is to talk about

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
how you can find derivatives implicitly in the Wolfram Language.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let’s try and do this in one way. For example, you could take the two functions

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
from the earlier page, from the earlier slide, and try to work out their derivatives separately.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You get back two answers. Now notice that each answer is of the form minus <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>—

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
so that’s <i>x</i>, that’s <i>y</i> and both answers have a certain pattern to them.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But then what we’ve got to remember is that this over here is the kind of upper branch,

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
so the derivative for the upper branch comes from here. If you plug in, let’s say, √2 and √2,

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that point, then what you get back is a slope of −1 at <i>x</i> = √2 for the upper branch.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You can then plot the line, the tangent line, and the circle, and you see that

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
that’s the correct solution. But of course this is a very roundabout way of doing things,

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and what we want to do today is to try and do things in a much more clear-cut, simple way,

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and that’s the notion of implicit differentiation. The idea is very simple.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Whenever you find the derivative with respect to <i>x</i>, you work just as before;

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but if you have a <i>y</i> anywhere in your expression, then you also make sure to multiply by <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
For example, here’s the equation from the earlier slide and you have <i>x</i>^2 + <i>y</i>^2 = 4,

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,000
so the derivative of <i>x</i>^2 is 2<i>x</i>, and the derivative of <i>y</i>^2 is not just 2<i>y</i>, but 2<i>y</i> times <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That’s just the chain rule. Okay. Once we have done that, then from the equation

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
you can solve for <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i> and find the answer is negative <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>, just as we noted earlier.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That’s the technique for doing implicit differentiation, and now I’ll show you how we can do it

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in the Wolfram Language. Let’s take up the circle again. There are two ways to go about it.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In the first method, what you do is you replace <i>y</i> by <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>]. Now the Wolfram Language knows that <i>y</i> is

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
indeed a function of <i>x</i>, and then you tell D to find the derivative. Then you solve that derivative

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
for <i>y</i>'[<i>x</i>]. What you get back is exactly what we guessed earlier on—namely, negative <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay. Now we can plug in values for both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. For example, if you’re at the point (−1, √3)

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,000
where the slope is 1/√3, and you can then find a tangent and plot both the tangent and the graph,

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and you see that the answer is correct. That’s the first method. The first method is replace <i>y</i> by <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>].

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The second method is slightly different. You start with the equation, but now do not make a replacement.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Instead, you tell D that <i>y</i> is no longer a constant, and that’s done with the NonConstants option.

42
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When you do that, you get back an equation for D. You solve it and you get back

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
just the same derivative as before, but now you only have a <i>y</i> instead of <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>].

44
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There are two ways: replace <i>x</i>/<i>y</i> or use the NonConstants option. Usually we’ll work with the first way.

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That’s a little more natural, but there will be another case where we’ll actually try and use

46
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the second method, but that will be in the exercises for the lesson.

47
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay. Having done this preparatory work, we can now find lots of derivatives with this method.

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
For example, here is a famous curve called the Folium of Descartes. That’s the equation

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
of the curve. We want to find the derivative, so you replace <i>y</i> by <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>], work out the derivative,

50
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
solve for it like over here and replace <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> with the values that you want to work with, 2 and 2,

51
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and you get back the derivative of this curve at (2, 2). Work out the tangent line,

52
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and then you plot the curve and the tangent, and it looks just right.

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
As another example, let’s take up the ellipse. That’s like a distorted circle,

54
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and you want to find the tangent line at the point (1, (−√3/2)). Again, you do the same thing:

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
replace <i>y</i> with <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>], solve the equation, plug in the values, get back the slope, set up the equation

56
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:09,000
for tangent and you get back the plot of the ellipse with the tangent line. Okay.

57
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
From the ellipse, we go on to the hyperbola. That’s the hyperbola equation. You want to work

58
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
at a certain point that’s given to you. Again, replace <i>y</i> with <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>], solve for <i>y</i>'[<i>x</i>],

59
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
plug in the values and you get back the slope. Write down the equation for tangent,

60
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and then you plot the tangent and the curve, and you get back this nice picture.

61
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Notice that in all these plots, I’m using the ContourPlot function to plot the curve itself

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
while using the Plot function to plot the tangent line.

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay. My next example is the so-called cardioid. That’s like a heart-shaped curve,

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
which is a pretty difficult equation. Here’s the equation of the curve. Replace <i>y</i> with <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>] as before,

65
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:21,000
find the derivative. It’s 1. Write our tangent equation, and then you plot the tangent of the curve,

66
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and you get back this beautiful plot of the cardioid.

67
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Another example is the so-called devil’s curve. Now it doesn’t matter

68
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
how difficult or easy the equation looks. You do just the same thing. You take the equation,

69
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
replace <i>y</i> with <i>y</i>'[<i>x</i>] everywhere. You’ve just seen it before, so now I’ll plug in

70
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the correct <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values, and when you do that, you get back the slope.

71
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Write down the equation for tangent, so that’s the <i>y</i>1, if you like, from your work on straight lines;

72
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
that’s the slope; and that’s <i>x</i> − <i>x</i>1. Okay. You plot the tangent and the curve.

73
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Notice one thing: the tangent line at this point might actually pass the curve again

74
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
because the curve in this case is like a loop attached to the location.

75
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay. Another example is the so-called kampyle of Eudoxus. That’s the equation,

76
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
but just the same method works: replace <i>y</i> by <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>], solve, replace values and you get back the slope.

77
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That’s the tangent line over here, and then you plot the tangent line and the curve,

78
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and you get back the correct solution.

79
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Having talked about derivatives, let’s now spend just a few minutes talking about multiple derivatives.

80
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Here’s an equation. You want to work out not just the first derivative, but also the second derivative

81
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
with implicit differentiation. You write the equation down. Replace <i>y</i> by <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>],

82
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:28,000
solve and find the derivative. Then you find the second derivative by putting the two over here

83
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
for the second derivatives, and you get back the second derivative.

84
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Unfortunately, the second derivative has the first derivative in it, but then you can use

85
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the earlier step to plug in values. You plug in the first solution into the second one,

86
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and you get back the second derivative now in a much simpler form

87
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
where it depends only on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.

88
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of this lesson. Basically, there are two ways

89
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
to compute the derivatives of implicit functions. In the first one, we express, let’s say,

90
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:23,000
<i>y</i> as a function of <i>x</i>. In the second one, we could use the NonConstants option.

91
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Now both methods have got their advantages and disadvantages, but overall,

92
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the first method is much closer to what you do by hand, and I recommend that

93
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you follow the first method. Of course we saw lots of interesting curves, and you could plot them

94
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and then actually work out the derivatives, and ContourPlot is a really good function

95
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:01,000
for plotting these curves. That’s the end of this lesson. The next lesson will talk about rates of change,

96
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but before doing that, you should definitely review today’s lesson, try lots of examples

97
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and make yourself ready for the next lesson. Of course, we’ll also have a problem session

98
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
before we go onto the next lesson. Thank you very much.

99
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I hope you’ve enjoyed the lesson. I’ll stop there.
