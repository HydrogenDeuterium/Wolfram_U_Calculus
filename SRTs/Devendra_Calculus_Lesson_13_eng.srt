00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 13 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is rates of change in the sciences.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let’s say you have a particle which moves along a straight line, for example.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The position at time <i>t</i> is given by this function <i>s</i>[<i>t</i>] that’s <i>t</i>^3 + 2<i>t</i> – 2. Now once you have

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the position as a function of time, what you can do is to compute the derivative,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then that will give you the velocity of the particle at time <i>t</i>. Here’s velocity. That’s 3<i>t</i>^2 + 2.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Once you have both <i>s</i> and <i>v</i>, you can then work out their values at any time. For example,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,000
at <i>t</i> = 10, the values are 1,018 and 302. Having done that, you can also plot

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the position and velocity as a function of time over a certain period of time—in this case,

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
from 0 to 20. In this very simple example, you see that the derivative gives you

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
a nice way of approaching a problem in mechanics. What we’ll do in this lesson is

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to explore the applications of differential calculus in the sciences in various different ways.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let’s again take up an example in mechanics where you have the position being given

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
as a function of time like over here. You could work out the velocity of course

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
as the first derivative, but you could also work out the acceleration, which is the second derivative.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Once we have done that, we could ask questions. For example, you could ask

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
when is the particle at rest? Well, it’s at rest when the velocity is 0. You could solve that equation

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and find out that the particle is at rest when <i>t</i> is either 2/3 or 2. Then you can plot the position,

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the velocity and the acceleration and get their graphs. You see that the position is given by

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the blue graph over here. The velocity is the graph over there, and it clearly intersects

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the time axis at around 2/3 and 2. The acceleration is a linear function of time.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The derivative is a very powerful way of studying problems in mechanics.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let’s go on to another example where let’s say you want to talk about the linear density of a rod.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now if you have a rod and, let’s say, it’s got mass <i>m</i> and a certain length,

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
then the average linear density is simply the mass divided by the length.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But of course what could happen is that the mass of the rod depends upon how far down

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you are on it. Let’s say the mass might be the cube root of the length, and in that case,

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you can talk about the linear density at a given length <i>l</i>. That is given by the derivative of the mass

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
with respect to <i>l</i>. In this case, it’s 1/(3³√(<i>l</i>^2)). Then of course you can work out the linear density

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
at any given length. In this case, if the length is 10, the answer is about 0.07.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then you can plot both the mass and the linear density. You see that the mass sort of has

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
constant increase, but the linear density goes down as the length increases

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
because of this expression for the derivative.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to current. If you have, let’s say, a wire

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and some current flows through it, then the average current is the charge that flows

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
in a certain period of time. But of course the charge itself might depend upon the time <i>t</i>

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
like over here, and then the current at any given instant will be the derivative of that charge

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
with respect to <i>t</i>. At, let’s say, one second, the current is 4 amperes. Then what you can do is

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to plot the charge and the current and get back a plot for both these quantities.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let’s go on now to chemistry. Now in chemistry, one talks about reactions—chemical reactions.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What happens there is that one or more reactants would undergo some process

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and give you some products.  For example, you might have two reactants <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that give you a product <i>C</i>. One talks about the concentration of any of these in moles per liter.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That concentration is of course a function of time as time goes by. For example, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> might

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
decrease in quantity and <i>C</i> might go up. In that case, the rate of reaction at an instant is given by

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
the derivative of the concentration with respect to <i>t</i>. For example, suppose that

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the concentration of <i>C</I> is given by 3<i>t</i>/(3<i>t</i> + 1). Then the rate of reaction at any given time

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
is a derivative, so it’s 3/(1 + 3<i>t</i>)^2. Then what you can do is to plot both these quantities,

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and you see that as time goes by, the concentration will increase, but of course

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the rate of reaction will go down as the system approaches a steady state.

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to biology. In biology, one talks about population models.

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
For example, the population at time <i>t</i> might be given by 2<i>t</i>^3 + <i>t</i>, and in that case,

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the growth rate for that population is the derivative of that population with respect to <i>t</i>.

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In this case, it’s just 6<i>t</i>^2 + 1. Then of course you can plot both the population and the growth rate

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
like we’ve done over here. In practice, one might have a slightly different model.

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
For example, if you talk about the growth of bacteria, then it might happen that

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the population doubles every minute, for example, in which case

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you might get a formula like the initial population times 2^<i>t</i>,

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and that’s what is called an exponential function.

61
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay. Finally, let’s go on to economics. In economics, one talks about the cost function.

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let’s say a company might talk about its cost function, which is a total cost of producing <i>x</i> units.

63
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Here’s a cost function in a particular case. Now if you find the derivative of the cost function,

64
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
then that’s what is called the marginal cost. The marginal cost, roughly speaking,

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is the amount of money it costs to produce an extra unit. For example, you might ask

66
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
what is the marginal cost and the actual cost of producing the 1,001st unit?

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That’s going to be the derivative of the cost at that value, or you could actually find it

68
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
by subtracting off the cost in both the cases, so 1,001 – 1,000. You see that they are very close,

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
but not quite the same. The marginal cost gives you a very good estimate of

70
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the cost to produce an extra unit. Once again, you can plot everything over here,

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the cost and the marginal cost, to get those two plots.

72
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of this lesson. The main point is that derivatives are used

73
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
universally in the sciences. If you’re a physicist, you might use them to study motion.

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If you’re a chemist, you might use them to study reaction rates, but if you’re a biologist,

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you might use them to study growth rates. Finally, it’s not just the natural sciences,

76
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but also the social sciences. In economics, you might use derivatives to find the marginal cost.

77
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Of course, there are many more uses of derivatives that we haven’t spoken about in this lesson,

78
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
but you will learn them as time goes by. The key point is that wherever the quantity is changing,

79
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
derivatives will play a key role. That brings me to the end of today’s lesson.

80
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The next lesson will talk about related rates, but before we do that, please review today’s lesson,

81
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
go over the exercises and make sure that you understand them really well

82
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
because derivatives are very import in sciences, and it’s important that you understand

83
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
how they can be used. I’ll stop over here. I hope you have enjoyed listening.

84
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you.
