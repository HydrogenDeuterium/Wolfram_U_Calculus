00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 14 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The topic for this lesson is related rates.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson. In most problems, there will be

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
more than one thing that is changing in relation to something else. For example,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you might have—of course time varies, but then two other things vary with time.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As a good instance of that, let’s talk about a ladder that’s falling along a side of a wall.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That’s the ladder. It’s falling along the wall, and there are two things that are changing:

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
there’s the height of the ladder from the top and the distance from the base of the ladder

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to the base of the wall. Both of these are changing as the ladder falls.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course, the rate at which the height is dropping and the rate at which

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the distance is increasing are related. That’s the theme for today’s lesson: related rates problems.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let’s begin with an example, and that’s exactly the one we talked about earlier on of the falling ladder,

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but now we’ve got numbers in it. We have a ladder that’s 5 feet long, and it’s resting initially

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
against a wall, and then it starts to slide down. Let’s say it slides down away from the wall

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
at a rate of 0.5 ft/s and the bottom of the ladder is 4 feet away from the wall at a certain point.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The question is how fast is the ladder sliding down at that time instant? The first step

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in this case is to assign variables to whatever is changing in the problem. There are two things

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that are changing. There is the height—<i>y</i>, let’s say—and the distance <i>x</i>.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Next I draw a picture of what’s happening. The picture is over here.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That’s the distance of the base, that’s the height and that’s the actual ladder over here.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay. Now to find a relationship between <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and 5 over here, you recall

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the Pythagorean theorem from geometry, and that says that <i>x</i>^2 + <i>y</i>^2 = 5^2.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That’s the relationship that we require between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. Now because we want to find the rates,

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
we differentiate that relation with respect to <i>t</i>. What you get back is 2<i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>x</i>'[<i>t</i>] + 2<i>y</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>y</i>'[<i>t</i>] = 0.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now keep in mind that <i>x</i> is 4 at that point, <i>x</i>' is 0.5, so you get back an equation which is

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
simpler than the earlier one, but it still ignored <i>y</i>’s. Then you recall the Pythagorean theorem,

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and that lets you find <i>y</i> as being 3. Once we’ve got <i>y</i>, we can plug that back in over here

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
to the earlier equation—that’s this one—and you get back the rate of change of <i>y</i> as being −0.666667.

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 0.67 ft/sec approximately. The question is

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
why is that sign negative? Well, it’s negative because the top of the ladder is actually going down.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Having solved that one problem, let’s set up a general strategy for solving such problems.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
First, always try to understand the problem. Make sure you know what you are asked to do.

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Next, assign symbols to all variables—<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, et cetera—in the problem.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now to help yourself understand the problem better, draw a picture. It doesn’t have to be very elegant,

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
but it should be just enough for you to understand what you need to do. Next, the creative part:

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
find an equation that relates all the variables in the problem. Usually something from geometry

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
is going to help you to do that. Next differentiate the equation with respect to time using the chain rule.

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That’s the key rule for today’s lesson. Now you already know a few variables,

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but you need to find any remaining unknown variables before you proceed. Once you have done that,

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
then you substitute all the information that you’ve found out and solve for the true

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
unknown quantity in the problem. That’s the general strategy for this lesson.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let’s try and apply it to a few more problems. Here you have a spherical balloon

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that’s being filled at a rate of 50 cm^3/sec. The question is find the rate at which

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the radius is increasing when the diameter is 25 cm. Now in this case, the volume and the radius

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
are both functions of time. Here’s a picture. It has the radius and the volume as being

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
the variables for the problem. Next, you know from geometry that the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π<i>r</i>^3,

47
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
so that’s the relation. Next you differentiate that relation, and you get back an equation

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:12,000
relating <i>v</I>', <i>r</i> and <i>r</i>'. Of course you need to find what <i>r</i> is at that time <i>t</i>, but you know the diameter

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
is twice the radius and the diameter is 25, so the radius at that time is 12.5.

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You plug back all the information that’s known to you, and you find that

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:35,000
the radius is increasing at roughly 0.025 cm/sec.

52
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
For the third problem, let’s talk about a watchdog. There is a cat that is walking down a street

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
at 3 feet per second. Now, a dog is sitting and sees this cat and stays focused on it.

54
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It doesn’t actually move, but then the dog is known to be 6 feet from the street

55
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and the cat is 8 feet from that point. The question is how fast is the dog’s head turning?

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There are two things that are changing: the dog’s head is turning and the cat is moving away.

57
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The question is what do you do over here? Well, you first draw a picture.

58
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That’s the angle of turning of the dog’s head, that’s the distance traveled by the cat down the street

59
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and this distance over here is given to us to be 6 feet. Now in this case

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
we have a right-angle triangle, so we can use the tangent of θ as the function <i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]/6.

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Once we have the relation over here, then you can differentiate it and you find that

62
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you have another relation for θ' now, but now you need to know what the secant of θ is.

63
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Well, the point is that you have the Pythagorean theorem, so you use that to work out

64
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the hypotenuse of the triangle at that time. It turns out to be 10. Use that to find the secant

65
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
like we’ve done over here. Once we’ve done that, you can plug in all the values

66
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and work out the rate at which the dog’s head is turning.

67
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The dog’s head is rotating at 9/50 radians/sec or about 10.313 degrees/sec.

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay. On to the final problem for the lesson. Oil is being poured into an inverted cone

69
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,000
at a rate of 3 m^3/sec. That’s the rate of change of the volume. Given that the cone’s height is 10 m

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and the radius is 5 m, the question is find the rate at which the oil level is rising

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:14,000
when the oil is 5 m deep. You’ve got two variables over here: the volume and the height.

72
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That’s the picture for the problem. Now, you know from geometry that the volume of a cone

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is given by (1/3)π<i>r</i>^2<i>h</i>, so that’s the equation for the problem.

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Notice that you in fact have <i>v</i>, <i>h</i> and <i>r</i>, and in fact you want to work only with <i>v</i> and <i>h</i>,

75
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so we need to do a bit more work. Recall that when you studied similar triangles,

76
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
then you could find a relationship between the base and height. In this case,

77
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the radius is going to be half the height in the oil tank because by similarity,

78
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
any cone in the tank has a radius equal to half the height because you have the initial ones

79
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and the same ratio. Here’s the volume equation with that relationship.

80
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You differentiate it and plug in values, and you find that oil level is rising at 12/25π m/s.

81
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of the lesson, but our main objective over here

82
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
was to solve problems which involved related rates. What we did was we set up

83
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a general strategy for these problems. Then we solved a few of them, but in each case,

84
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
what you need to do is to use the given information and then apply some geometry

85
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,000
typically to get the equations required for the problem. That’s the end of this topic.

86
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about linear approximations, but before we do that,

87
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
do review this lesson. This was a pretty advanced application of calculus.

88
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It’s just that we now know calculus so well that we can apply things quite easily,

89
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but do review this lesson, look at the exercises and you should be ready for the next one

90
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
on linear approximations. I’ll stop over here. Thank you.
