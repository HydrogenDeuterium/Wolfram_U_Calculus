00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 15 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is linear approximations.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of this lesson. You may recall that the derivative of a function

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is calculated by zooming in on it with some limits. Typically you take some limit as,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
let’s say, <i>h</i>→0 or some other variable, and the point is that as you get closer and closer

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to a desired point, then the function begins to look like its tangent line.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For example, here’s a function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2, and that’s the function, that’s the tangent line.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We can see that very close to the point (1, 1), they both look essentially identical.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can use this property to approximate a function near a point with its tangent line,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and that’s a dramatic simplification. After all, a curve is a rather complicated object,

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and a straight line is perhaps the simplest of geometrical objects. If you can replace a function

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
with its tangent line, that’s great, and that’s the topic of this lesson. Namely, we’d like to

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
talk about linear approximations, but we’ll also talk about so-called differentials

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and some of their applications.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let’s begin with the topic of linear approximation. You may recall that the tangent line at any point,

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>x</i> = <i>a</i>, is given by an equation of that type. Now, the <i>y</i> over here is a point on the tangent line,

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but what you could do is to replace <i>y</i> by <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], the function itself, and then you get

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
an approximate quality whereby the value of <i>f</i> at <i>x</i> can be approximated by using its derivative

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
at the point <i>a</i>. This approximation is called the linear approximation of <i>f</i> at <i>a</i>

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because the tangent line is being used to approximate <i>f</i>. Here’s a picture. You have the function

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and you have tangent line, and the tangent line is now called the linearization.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Linear approximations are a very important tool in calculus, and as an example,

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
let’s take this function, <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = Sqrt[<i>x</i> + 8]. What we want to do is to approximate values of

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the square root at 8.98 and 9.03 within this function. Obviously when <i>x</i> is 1,

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the square root of 9 is just 3, so what we do is we work near 1, and we get back <i>f</i>'[1] is 1/6.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now you set up the equation of the tangent line. Tangent is equal to 3 + (1/6)(<i>x</i> − 1),

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and you get back the tangent expression. Now when <i>x</i> is 0.98, you are at 8.98.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The next one is 1.03—then you are at 9.03. You can use the tangent line to approximate

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the values over there, and those are the square roots at those two points approximately.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Here’s the picture, and in the picture, you see you have the function, the linear approximation

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and the values at the nearby points. You can see that the approximations are very, very close

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to the original function, though of course they are not exactly the same.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay. The question now is how accurate is that approximation? Suppose you want to have

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
an accuracy of within 0.5 units. Well, here’s the equation. That’s the exact expression

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and that’s the tangent. You want that difference to be less than 0.5. What you can do is

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
set up an equation with the reduced function and solve. Numerically, the values

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
lie between −6.3 and 14.39. As long as you stay within that range of <i>x</i>, you’ll get an approximation

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
which is correct within 0.5 units. Now, let’s say you want to increase the accuracy to be less than 0.1.

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then you set up the equation with 1/10 over here, and you get back the values. In this case,

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
we have a much tighter range from −3.04 to 6.2, roughly.

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay. In physics, one needs this notion of linear approximation all the time.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
For example, when one studies the pendulum and you want to talk about

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the period of the pendulum, you start with the equation for the acceleration.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That’s the tangential acceleration <i>at</i> and <i>g</i> is the acceleration for gravity.

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
θ is the angle that the pendulum makes with the vertical. The point is that

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
when your rate goes to 0, then sine has got a slope of 1 because cosine of 0 is 1,

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and the value of sine at (0, 0)—so near 0 when θ is very small, Sin[θ] is approximately equal to θ.

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you replace the Sin[θ] over there with the θ, then you get back a much simpler equation,

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and that’s the one that’s used in physics textbooks at the elementary level. As you go more advanced,

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
of course you might want a better approximation. Here’s a picture of the actual acceleration,

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
the current one, and the linear approximation. Of course, you see that they are both

52
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
very close by as long as you do not go very far away from 0.

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay. A related notion is the notion of a differential. To understand that, remember that

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the derivative is sometimes denoted as <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>. Now <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i> is the same as <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>],

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
so if you kind of cross-multiply, then you get the equation <i>dy</i> = <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.

56
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
These quantities <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i> are called differentials, so they represent the change in <i>x</i>

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and the change in <i>y</i> respectively. Of course if you’re given <i>dx</i> over here, then you can

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
work out <i>dy</i> using <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]. That’s like a small machine where as you put in different <i>dx</i>s over here,

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you get different <i>dy</i>s over there. Here’s a picture. The picture is that

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
as you stay close to <i>x</i> over here, then you can use the approximation to find the change in <i>y</i>.

61
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But of course that’s still approximate, so the question is how does that relate to the actual differences?

62
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Here’s an example where you have a function, and the problem is to work out <i>df</i>,

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the approximate change, and the actual change when <i>x</i> goes from 3 to 3.05. Let’s first work out

64
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the exact change using subtraction. Now here is the approximate change given by <i>df</i>,

65
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and you can see they are pretty close to each other. In general, that’s the equation for

66
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the change in <i>f</i> when you make a small change in <i>x</i>. Here’s a picture of the function

67
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and its approximation, and you can see, again, that as long as you stay close to 3,

68
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the approximation is quite good.

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay. The question is why are differentials important? The reason why they’re important is that

70
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
sometimes you may not be able to find Δ<i>f</i> that actually is <i>f</i> exactly, and then you might as well

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
use the differential because they are really quite helpful and easy to work with.

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In fact, what we’re talking about over here is exactly the same as linear approximations.

73
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Here’s the equation for a linear approximation in the differential language:

74
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:53,000
<i>f</i>[<i>x</i> + <i>dx</i>] is the value of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] + <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>. As an example, here is the function Sqrt[<i>x</i> + 8] again.

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That’s the differential. You plug in the value of −0.02 for <i>dx</i>, and then you see that it’s pretty close

76
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to the value of the function at 0.98. The point is that differentials are

77
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
just another way of talking about linear approximations.

78
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay. One important place where they are useful is when you want to estimate errors.

79
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
For example, suppose that the radius of the sphere is 11 cm and you know that

80
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the error in measurement is about 0.1 cm. What you want to do is to find out

81
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the maximum error when you calculate the volume of the sphere.

82
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now the volume of a sphere is 4/3π<i>r</i>^3, so you differentiate that equation. Now volume prime

83
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
is the same as <i>dvol</i>/<i>dr</i>, so you can rewrite the equation as <i>dvol</i> = 4π^2<i>dr</i>,

84
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and then because <i>r</i> is 11 and <i>dr</i> is 0.1—that’s the error—you can work out the error in the volume.

85
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It turns out to be 152, approximately. Now that looks like a huge number.

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The question is why is it so large? Well, the point is that you really need to talk about

87
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the relative error over here to understand what’s happening. The relative error is the error

88
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
divided by the actual volume, and then that is just 0.027, so of course things look

89
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
much better than they did before. If you do not plug in the value of <i>r</i> over here,

90
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:07,000
then the relative error looks like 3<i>dr</i>/<i>r</i>, but that’s just 3 times the relative error and the radius.

91
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That says that the error in the volume is three times the error in the radius,

92
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
provided that you talk about relative elements. Now the other way to talk about these errors

93
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is to use a percentage error. The percentage error in this case

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
is 2.7 for the volume and 0.9 for the radius.

95
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay. That brings us to the end of this lesson, and the main point is that

96
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
linear approximations are very important in mathematics and science. All we do

97
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
in such a case is replace a function by its tangent line. As long as you stay close to the point,

98
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
then the approximation is very close to the actual function. One place where you might find them

99
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
really useful is in physics, but of course they are also useful in chemistry

100
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and in economics and in finance. Wherever you go, you will find the need to use linear approximations.

101
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Another way of talking about these approximations is to use differentials,

102
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and those are particularly useful when you want to talk about errors in measurements.

103
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson. In the next lesson we’ll talk about maxima and minima,

104
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
but before doing that, we will have a problem session to go over some examples

105
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
for errors and approximations, and then we’ll get back to maxima and minima.

106
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I hope you’ve found this lesson useful. It’s a very important lesson.

107
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Do review it and be ready for the next session. Thank you.
