00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 16 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is maxima and minima.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson. Many mathematical problems involve

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
getting the best solution for a task. In fact, people use mathematics when they really do want

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the best solution for a task. There’s a word for best solution. It’s usually called optimal solution,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and the whole process of getting such a solution is called optimization.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay. As an example of optimization, let’s take this function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and plot it.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The plot is a downward-opening parabola, and the highest value of this plot is clearly at (0, 3).

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In this case, our notion of best or optimal is the highest value. Typically, one wants to talk about

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
maxima and minima in various problems. The goal of this lesson is to develop a process

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
for finding maxima or minima for different problems using derivatives.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Various people use optimization in different ways. For example, if you run a business,

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
then clearly what you want to do is to maximize your profit and minimize your cost.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Even a plant knows that it must grow in such a way that it obtains the maximum amount of sunlight.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A GPS system is designed to get you to a destination in either the shortest amount of time or distance.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In general, you have optimization problems which involve either finding the maximum or the minimum.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Differential calculus is really an excellent tool for solving these optimization problems.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In fact, that’s how the subject arose in the works of Fermat and other mathematicians.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let’s now go ahead and talk about the notion of an absolute maximum or minimum.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
A value <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>] is an absolute maximum of a function if its value is greater than or equal to

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
every other value for the values in a certain set D where D is called the domain.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
When I say maximum and I say absolute maximum, I mean the very greatest value of a function.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Similarly, if one says absolute minimum, you mean the least value of a function on a certain set D.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
For example, if we take the sine function, clearly its maximum is over here at π/2

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
where it’s got a value of 1, and its minimum is at 3π/2 where it’s got the value −1.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Another term used for absolute maximum and minimum is global maximum and minimum.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
When you say absolute, it means the same thing as global.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay. Together, these maxima and minima are sometimes called the extreme values of the function.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In this case, we’re lucky. We had an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But in general, the best that you can hope for are so-called local maxima and minima.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For example, here is a function, a cubic function, and you can see quite clearly that

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
this graph has got local maxima and minima. That’s the local maximum over here,

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and that’s the local minimum over there, but if you go far away enough, the values will

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:25,000
go up or go down dramatically. The idea of a local maximum is that you have a value <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>]

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
which is more than other values for <i>x</i> near <i>c</i>, and similarly for local minima.

36
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Near depends upon the function of course, but that’s a nice way about talking about maxima and minima—

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
by using the local definition rather than the global definition. In the case over here,

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
there is a local maximum at that point and a local minimum at that point.

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We’ll see that quite shortly. Of course, if you have an absolute maximum,

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that’s clearly a local maximum, and if you have an absolute minimum, that’s clearly a local minimum.

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The fact that you have absolute maxima and minima is very special knowledge—

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
much better than having local maxima or minima.

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay. Things could go wrong or be different in some cases. For example, if you have

44
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the constant function like over here, the constant function 5, then clearly every real number is

45
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
an absolute maximum and minimum. On the other hand, if you have the cubic function over here,

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
then you have neither an absolute or local maximum or minimum everywhere.

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
These are very special cases which are worth remembering as we talk about maxima and minima.

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Namely, you could have situations in which you have everything being optimal or nothing being optimal.

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay. Now the question is how do we find these extreme values, but even if we’re talking about that,

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
we need to figure out some conditions under which one can guarantee that they’re extreme values.

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is what’s called the extreme value theorem. What that does is it gives you conditions

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
for when a function is guaranteed to have extreme values. It says that if you have a function

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
on a closed interval and that function is continuous—so you have a continuous function

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
on a closed interval [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]—then that function will attain an absolute maximum

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and an absolute minimum at some numbers <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> on the interval. As long as you have

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
a continuous function and a closed interval, you are fine. For example, I have these three plots over here,

57
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and the black dots will indicate that that side of the interval is closed, and the white dots

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
or the blank dots will indicate that you have an interval side which is not closed.

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In the first example, you see you’ve got two black dots, so that’s a closed interval,

60
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and clearly you have a continuous function. There are no breaks in the graph.

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You have an absolute minimum over here and an absolute maximum over there.

62
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That’s the first example. It attains an absolute maximum and minimum on the interval.

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
On the other hand, the second example is not in the scope of the discussion today

64
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
because you have over here a function which is not continuous. You can see over here that

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
there’s a sort of break in the graph. The theorem does not apply and you do not need to worry about

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
whether there are absolute maxima or minima, but of course in this case,

67
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you actually do not have them because the function seems to go off to minus infinity over here

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and plus infinity over there. The last example is again not quite relevant

69
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
because here you have an open interval. Because the interval is not closed, or is open,

70
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
therefore you cannot guarantee anything from the extreme value theorem. But in fact in this case,

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
there is neither an absolute maximum or minimum precisely because of the issue of missing endpoints.

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay. The question now is how do we actually find these extreme values.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The best tool we have for this is Fermat’s theorem given by Pierre de Fermat a long time ago.

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What that does is it lets us find local maxima and minima. What it says is if <i>f</i> has

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
a local maximum or minimum, then its derivative at that point must be 0. For example,

76
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
if you look at the earlier function, then the claim is that it’s got local maxima and minima

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
over here and there, and you can check that with the derivatives at those points. They are both 0,

78
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
so Fermat’s theorem will say that that’s the condition to be satisfied for local maxima and minima.

79
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay. There are a few things to remember about Fermat’s theorem. The converse is not true,

80
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and it’s not true in a few ways. For example, we have a function over here, a cubed function,

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and clearly you have a horizontal tangent over here. The derivative is 0,

82
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and yet there are no maxima or minima. The theorem mainly says that if you have

83
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
a maximum or minimum, then the derivative must be 0. The other example is

84
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the absolute value function where you do have a minimum, but then the derivative does not exist

85
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
at that point. Fermat’s theorem must be used with caution, but it is in fact a very powerful theorem.

86
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Fermat’s theorem is really talking about what are called critical numbers.

87
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When you want to look for maxima and minima, you need to look for what are called critical numbers.

88
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What’s a critical number? Well, a critical number is a number where either you have a 0 derivative

89
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
or the derivative does not exist. For example, the cube root function has a critical point

90
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
over here because the derivative is not defined there.

91
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Of course, the local maxima and minima are good places to look for critical points.

92
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
With all that information, we are now ready to put together a method for finding absolute maxima and minima.

93
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That’s what is called the closed interval method. What it says is to find the absolute maximum

94
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and minimum of a continuous function on a closed interval, you first of all find out

95
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the critical numbers, find out the values of the function at those critical numbers,

96
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,000
then you work out the value at the endpoints and then the largest of all those values

97
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is the absolute maximum and the smallest value will be the absolute minimum.

98
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
As an example, here’s a cubic function. We find the derivative, set it equal to 0 and figure out

99
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that 1 is a critical point. Add that 1 to the list 0 and 2. You’ve got to look at 0, 1 and 2.

100
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
0 and 2 are the endpoints of the interval, 1 is a critical point, and you find that

101
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
the minimum value occurs at −1 and the maximum value occurs at 2.

102
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You have an absolute maximum at (2, 2) and you have an absolute minimum at (−1, 1).

103
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We have two very nice functions called Maximize and Minimize which will do that

104
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
automatically for you, and there you are. It says that the maximum is at (2, 2)

105
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and the minimum is at (−1, 1), just as we learned earlier on. But the closed interval method

106
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
is the basic tool for finding maxima and minima on a closed interval.

107
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
As an application, let’s take this example. We have the cost function for a business,

108
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and the question is to find the number of units <i>x</i> that minimize the cost. What you do is

109
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you find the critical points. There’s just one over here. It’s about 6,790.

110
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You plug in the critical point and the endpoints over here. Then what you do is you work out

111
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the values at those points, and you find out that you need to produce around 6,790 units

112
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
to minimize the cost. Here’s a plot for the problem, and you can see quite clearly that

113
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you actually do have a minimum somewhere around 7,000. That’s the end of this lesson.

114
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let’s summarize. We certainly realize that optimization is a crucial component of our lives

115
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
from day to day. Different people will use it in different ways. For example, businesses will want

116
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to make the most money with the least amount of cost, while drivers might want to reduce

117
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the time that they take to go from one place to another. The basic tool in this area is Fermat’s theorem,

118
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
which lets us find the critical numbers for a function. The closed interval method is

119
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
a complete method for finding the absolute maxima and minima. That’s the end of this lesson.

120
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The next lesson will talk about the mean value theorem, a very important theorem in calculus.

121
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But before we do that, please do review today’s lesson, look at the exercises and make sure that

122
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
you’re ready for the next lesson on the mean value theorem. Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
