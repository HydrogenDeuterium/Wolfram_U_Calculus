Hello, and welcome to Lesson 17 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is the mean value theorem.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson. The mean value theorem, roughly speaking,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
relates to the slope of an interval with the instantaneous slope of some point in that interval.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now let’s look at that a little bit more in detail. Here you’ve got a curve,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and I joined the two endpoints over here by a secant. What the theorem is saying is that

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the slope of this interval over here is somehow related to the slope of this tangent at some point.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That’s what the theorem is about, about the slopes of intervals and the slopes of tangents.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The goal of this lesson is to first of all understand the mean value theorem

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and then give a few applications of the theorem. We’ll begin with

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
a special case of the theorem called Rolle’s theorem.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
As a motivation for Rolle’s theorem, let’s look at the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here is a plot of the function as a parabola. Notice that the value of the function

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,000
at the two endpoints −2 and 2 is the same, and the slope at 0, the derivative, is 0.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That’s the hint for Rolle’s theorem, that the slope is 0 at the top, and you also have a tangent,

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
so to speak, at which the slope is 0. Now a more formal statement of Rolle’s theorem,

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
which was proved by Michel Rolle. What it says is that if you have a function

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that satisfies three hypotheses—first of all, it is continuous on a certain closed interval;

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
it is differentiable on an open interval; and the value of the function at the left endpoint

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is the same as the value at the right endpoint—then there is a number <i>c</i>

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in the interval at which the derivative becomes 0. The previous function we talked about in fact

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
satisfies all the three hypotheses. After all, you do have a continuous function,

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it’s differentiable and the values at both the end points are the same.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Here’s a plot which just confirms the theorem and says that the slope of this secant line

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
is the same as the slope of that tangent over there, which is 0.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay. Now on to the problems with Rolle’s theorem and how you apply it.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:17,000
First of all, let’s look at 1/<i>x</i>^2 on the interval (−1, 1). Notice that it has a discontinuity at 0,

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so of course it’s not differentiable over there as well.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The values at the endpoints are certainly equal; however, it does not satisfy all the hypotheses

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
of Rolle’s theorem, and hence we cannot guarantee that there is any number in this range

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
at which the slope is 0. In fact, we confirm that using Solve, and we check that the derivative

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is never 0 in this interval.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
As another issue with the theorem, let’s look at the absolute value function between −1 and 1.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Clearly that is continuous, but it is not differentiable at <i>x</i> = 0. There’s a corner at <i>x</i> = 0.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The value of the function at both endpoints is the same, but since it does not satisfy

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
all the hypotheses of Rolle’s theorem—therefore you cannot guarantee that there is a number

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
at which the slope is 0. Once again, you can use Solve to confirm that there is no such value.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That’s the derivative of the absolute value function on the interval, and it’s never 0 on that interval.

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay. Now on to the mean value theorem and some motivation. In the earlier example,

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we said that the secant line between −2 and 2 and the tangent line at 0 had the same slope.

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now the whole situation over here is very symmetrical, so what we’ll do is we’ll make it

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
slightly less symmetrical by looking at the interval [−0.5, 1]. That’s the interval over here.

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now we notice that the secant line at <i>x</i> = −0.5 and <i>x</i> = 1, the line joining those two points,

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:21,000
has got a slope 1/2. We can calculate that. The same thing happens at <i>x</i> = 1/4—namely, the tangent line

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
at that point has a slope of 1/2. The mean value theorem is just a modification,

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
a more general version of Rolle’s theorem. Here is a formal statement of the theorem which says that

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
suppose you have a function <i>f</i> that is continuous on a closed interval, differentiable on

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the open interval in that case. Then there is a number <i>c</i> in the interval at which

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the slope of the tangent line equals the slope of the secant line joining the endpoints.

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:17,000
More formally, <i>f</i>'(<i>c</i>) = (<i>f</i>(<i>b</i>) − <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>))/(<i>b</i> − <i>a</i>). Sometimes it’s easier to cross-multiply and get

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
the same equation in a slightly different form like is done over here. Now of course,

52
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Rolle’s theorem follows from the mean value theorem because if you set <i>f</i>[<i>b</i>] equal to <i>f</i>[<i>a</i>],

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
then you have <i>f</i>'[<i>c</i>] equal to 0 at the point <i>c</i>.

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That’s the Rolle’s theorem for the sine function on the interval [0, π].

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There are some issues with the mean value theorem I have interpreted.

56
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
For example, we could have more than one <i>c</i>, which satisfies the theorem. Here you have a curve

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
in which that’s the secant line and those two tangents have the same slope as the secant line.

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In fact, if you have a constant function like <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = 5, then the slope is 0 everywhere.

59
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Here’s the constant function 5, and if you plot the function derivative, you see that

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the theorem is satisfied everywhere. You have some exceptions with the mean value theorem

61
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
when you have either more than one value, or you might even have infinitely many values

62
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
because if the slope happens to be 0, then the function must be constant.

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay. With that, some applications. For the first application, let’s look at the function <i>x</i>^3 − 8<i>x</i>

64
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
on the interval 0 to 4, and you want to find a <i>c</i> in the range which has a tangent line

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
parallel to the secant line to the endpoints. For the first step, you know that the mean value theorem

66
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
is certainly applicable because you have a polynomial function. You solve for <i>c</i> or <i>x</i>

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
like this equation, and the value of <i>c</i> or <i>x</i> is the value of 4/√3. At that value of <i>x</i>,

68
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
we actually have a tangent line that is parallel to the secant line through the two endpoints.

69
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now let’s check that with the tangent line and a plot of the curve and tangent,

70
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and you can see that the secant line over here has the same slope as the tangent line over there.

71
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay. As another example of the mean value theorem, let’s talk about a function <i>f</i>

72
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
whose value at 0 is 4 and whose derivative is bounded above by 6, and the question is how large

73
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
can the value of <i>f</i> at 3 possibly be? Because <i>f</i> is differentiable, therefore clearly it is continuous,

74
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and so what we’ll do is we’ll apply the mean value theorem on the interval [0, 3].

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The mean value theorem says that you have the equation <i>f</i>(3) − <i>f</i>(0) is the value of the derivative

76
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:27,000
at that point <i>c</i> times (3 − 0). You have a <i>c</i> with that property. Because you have <i>f</i>' less than

77
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
or equal to 6, therefore you set up the equation, which is <i>f</i>'[<i>c</i>], to be at most 6 and solve it for <i>f</i>[<i>3</i>],

78
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and you find that the value of <i>f</i>[3] can be at the most 22.

79
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay. As another example, let’s try and show that this polynomial, <i>x</i>^3 + 8<i>x</i> − 2, has exactly one root.

80
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because the function is continuous, you can apply the intermediate value theorem to try and show

81
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:12,000
that a root exists. The point is that the value of <i>f</i> at 0 is negative and the value at 1 is positive,

82
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
so the function must take every value between those two values, so at some point or the other,

83
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
it must become 0, so you certainly have a root in the interval 0 to 1.

84
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now let’s suppose there are two roots, <i>a</I> and <i>b</i>. Then the mean value theorem would say

85
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
that you actually have a slope of 0 between them, and hence you have a point <i>c</i>

86
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
for which the slope is 0 as well. Then if we look at the derivative, it’s 3<i>x</i>^2 + 8,

87
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
which can never be 0, so it’s clear that you only have one root,

88
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but let’s just plot the function and make sure. You see over here that the function

89
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
becomes zero somewhere to the right of 0, but then never again.

90
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Now as an amusing application of the mean value theorem, let’s talk about speed limits.

91
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Suppose you’ve got two points, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, on a road, and they are 90 miles apart.

92
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You start from point <i>A</i> at noon. Suppose you don’t take any breaks in your journey,

93
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and you get to the point <i>B</i> at 1 o’clock. Now, the speed limit in that area says that

94
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
you cannot exceed 80 miles per hour. The question is should you receive a speeding ticket or not?

95
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, here’s the average speed for the whole trip. It’s 90. If you apply the mean value theorem,

96
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
at some point, you must surely have crossed the speed limit of 80 miles per hour,

97
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
so certainly you should receive a speeding ticket, and it’s going to cost you some money.

98
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay. Let’s summarize the lesson for today. We saw that the mean value theorem relates

99
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the average slope of an interval with the instantaneous slope in the interval. Basically it says that

100
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
you’ve got a point at which the average slope is the same as the instantaneous slope.

101
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Of course this theorem is a very useful theorem. We saw some applications,

102
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but in the next lesson, we’ll see even more where we’ll talk about the graphs of functions.

103
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That’s really a very interesting geometrical problem which gets solved nicely

104
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
with the use of the mean value theorem and other properties of derivatives.

105
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But before we do that, do look over today’s lesson, do review the exercises

106
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and be ready for the lesson on graphs of functions. I’ll stop over here. Thank you.
