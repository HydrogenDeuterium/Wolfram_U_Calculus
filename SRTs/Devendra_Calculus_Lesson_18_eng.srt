00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 18 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The topic for this lesson is derivatives and the shapes of graphs.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let’s begin with an overview of the lesson. In the last lesson we spoke about the mean value theorem,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and you might have gotten just a hint as to how powerful this theorem is, but in this lesson,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we’ll actually see that power in action. We’ll actually learn how the derivative of a function

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
can be used to sketch its graph. That’s a very beautiful application of all the calculus ideas

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we’ve learned so far. For example, here’s the function <i>f</I>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2. That’s the derivative of the function.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now the function itself, of course, is just a parabola in terms of its graph, and the derivative is

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
a straight line graph. The point is that starting from this derivative, you can actually plot

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the original function, and that’s the theme of this lesson. The goal of this lesson is

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
to develop a way for sketching such graphs. Let’s begin by building some intuition.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let’s again look at the graphs of <i>x</i>^2 and its derivative. We have the function on the right,

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the derivative on the left. You see that when <i>x</i> is negative, the derivative is negative,

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and that says that the function is decreasing. When <i>x</i> is positive, the derivative is positive,

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and that says that the function is increasing. Finally, when <i>x</i> is 0, the derivative is 0,

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and that says that the function is horizontal just at that point. With that background,

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we can now talk about the increasing and decreasing function test.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But let’s begin with the mean value theorem, which says that <i>f</i>(<i>b</i>) – <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>) = <i>f</i>'(<i>c</i>)(<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
for some value <i>c</i> between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. If <i>f</i>'(<i>c</i>) happens to be positive for all <i>c</i>, then assuming that (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
is positive—so <i>b</i> is greater than <i>a</i>—then we have <i>f</i>(<i>b</i>) greater than <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>), so the function is

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
increasing on that interval. Using the mean value theorem, we can show that if the derivative is positive,

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
then the function is increasing. In just the same way, if the derivative is negative,

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
then the function is decreasing on that interval. These two facts together are called

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the increasing/decreasing test. As an example, here is the plot for <i>x</i>^3 and its derivative.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You see that the function is increasing everywhere, and if you look at <i>f</i>', the derivative,

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
then it is non-negative at all points. The function is increasing everywhere except at 0,

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
where it’s horizontal, and that’s what we see from looking at the derivative for the function.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The derivative of a function tells you where the function increases or decreases.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now as an example, here is a cubic function, and you want to find out where it increases or decreases

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
without actually plotting the function. For the first step, let’s find where the derivative is 0,

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and you find that it’s 0 when <i>x</i> is either –2 or 1. In other words, we now know that

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the graph must be horizontal at those two values of <i>x</i>. What we’ll do is

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
we’ll break the horizontal line up into three parts: the part from –∞ to –2, then from –2 to 1

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and then 1 to ∞. Now you pick a typical point on each of these intervals. You pick, let’s say, −3

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
in the first case, 0 in the second case and 2 in the third case. –3 lies between –∞ and –2, et cetera.

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Work out derivatives, and you find that at the first point, the derivative is positive,

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and so it is at the third point as well, while the second point is negative.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That says that the function is increasing on the first interval and the third interval,

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and it’s decreasing on the second interval. Here’s a plot of the derivative and the function.

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You see over here that the orange graph is the function itself. When the function increases,

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the derivative is going to be positive. When the function decreases, the derivative dips down

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
below the <i>x</i> axis, and then as it increases again, the derivative becomes positive. That says that

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the derivative gives you pretty good information about the increasing or decreasing nature of the function.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay. How about maxima and minima? Let’s talk about maxima and minima, and look again

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
at the earlier function. You see that it’s got a maximum over here at –2 and a minimum at 1,

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and they are both local maxima and minima. What you notice is that when <i>x</i> is –2,

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the derivative goes from being positive to being negative. It’s positive initially,

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
then becomes negative. Just the opposite happens at the minimum where the derivative is

49
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
first negative and then positive. Now if you look at, on the other hand, the graph of <i>x</i>^3,

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
then you see over here that the derivative does not change signs as it goes through 0.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That says that you do not have a local maximum or minimum roughly.

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay. Now we can talk about the first derivative test, which says that if the first derivative

53
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
changes from positive to negative at a point, then that point has a local maximum for the function,

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and just the opposite happens at a local minimum where the derivative changes

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
from being negative to being positive. On the other hand, if the derivative

56
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
does not change signs at a point, then the function neither has

57
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
a local maximum or minimum at that point. As an example, look at the sine function and its derivative.

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It’s just the cosine function. Here’s the sine function, and you see over here that

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
you have a maximum at π/2 and the derivative goes from being positive to being negative.

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
On the other hand, you have a minimum at 3π/2, and the derivative goes

61
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
from being negative to being positive. Okay. That’s about first derivatives.

62
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How about second derivatives? Here is the graph of <I>x</i>^3, and its second derivative is 6<i>x</i>.

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You see over here that when the second derivative is negative,

64
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the slope becomes progressively smaller. It slows down, so to speak, the function.

65
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
When the second derivative is positive, the slope progressively gets bigger.

66
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can see that over here. In the first case, you would say that the curve is concave downward,

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and in the second case, you would say it’s concave upward. It’s concave downward over here,

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and concave upward over there. As another example, let’s look at the sine function

69
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and its second derivative. You see over here that it’s concave downward when

70
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the second derivative is negative and concave upward when the second derivative is positive.

71
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now we can put all that together and talk about the concavity test,

72
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
which says that if the second derivative is positive on an interval,

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
then the graph is concave upward. The short form of that is cup, just like a cup of water.

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If the second derivative is negative, then the graph is concave downward. That’s like a frown.

75
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It cannot hold any water in it. That’s a nice test for concavity. Another way of looking at it

76
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
is to look at tangent lines. Here’s a function <i>x</i>^2, and the second derivative is 2, which is positive.

77
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You see over here that all the tangent lines lie below the graph when you have

78
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
a concave upward graph. All the tangent lines lie below in this case, and if it happened to be

79
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
concave downward, then of course all the tangent lines would lie above the curve.

80
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay. Now on to inflection points, where you neither have concave upward or concave downward

81
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
just at that point. In fact, the curve will switch from being concave upward to being concave downward

82
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
at an inflection point. Here’s an example of such a function where you have an inflection point

83
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
at 1 roughly. You have concave downward over here and concave upward over there.

84
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Now what’s happening over here is that the slope will reach a maximum or a minimum value

85
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
at a point of this type where you have an inflection point, and so the slope is of course a derivative,

86
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and hence the inflection points are precisely those where the second derivative

87
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
is either 0 or not defined. In the case of this function over here, let’s just check what happens

88
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
if you set the second derivative to be 0 and solve for <i>x</i>.

89
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You find that at <i>x</i> = 1, you actually have an inflection point.

90
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay. Finally let’s talk about the second derivative test, which says that

91
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
if you have a particular point and the second derivative is positive, then the function has

92
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
a local minimum, and if it’s negative, the second derivative, then you have a local maximum.

93
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Looking again at the earlier function, you see over here that when you’re at 0, then you have

94
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the slope of 0 and the graph is concave downward, so you have a local maximum.

95
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Just the reverse happens at 2 where you have a local minimum. That’s how the second derivative

96
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
is quite a powerful tool for distinguishing between a maximum and a minimum.

97
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It’s time to summarize. You learned quite a lot in this lesson. First of all, we learned that

98
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the mean value theorem is crucial for understanding how to graph a function starting from its derivative.

99
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We learned about the increasing/decreasing test for when a function increases or decreases.

100
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We learned the first derivative test for finding local maxima and minima.

101
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We talked about the concavity test for figuring out when the function is concave upward or downward,

102
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and that relies on the second derivative. We spoke about inflection points,

103
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
where the curve kind of changes shape. Finally, the second derivative test tells us that

104
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
you can use the first and second derivatives together to find the local maxima and minima.

105
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That’s the end of this lesson. The next lesson will talk about

106
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
limits at infinity and horizontal asymptotes. Before doing that, do review this lesson, do look at

107
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the exercises and make sure you follow this topic really well before you begin the next lesson.

108
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop here.
