00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 19 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The topic for this lesson is asmyptotes. Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In the past, we have learned how to calculate the limits of functions at points.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For example, if I said find the limit of 3<i>x</i> as <i>x</i>→2, then the answer of course is just 6.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But you can also take limits at positive or negative infinity. For example, if you said

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
a limit of 3<i>x</i> as <i>x</i>→∞, the answer is ∞. At –∞, just the opposite happens; you get back –∞.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now the nice thing is that although you might have infinite limits, the actual answer might be finite.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In this case, you have the limit of 1/<i>x</i> as <i>x</i>→∞ going to 0. There are various kinds of

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
of interesting behaviors taking place at infinity, and these are so-called end behaviors of functions.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That’s the theme for this lesson, which will be used to sketch graphs eventually.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let’s begin with some more motivation and talk about horizontal asymptotes.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you look at this table over here, it’s a table for 1/<i>x</i> as <i>x</i>→∞, and you see that as <i>x</i> becomes larger,

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the value of 1/<i>x</i> becomes smaller. As <i>x</i> approaches ∞, 1/<i>x</i> gets closer and closer to 0,

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and hence 0 is a horizontal asymptote of 1/<i>x</i>. You can actually check that in a plot.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You see over here you have the graph of 1/<i>x</i>, and that’s the horizontal asymptote.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It’s just a horizontal line to which the plot approaches as <i>x</i>→∞.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now a more formal definition. The limit of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] is <i>L</i> as <i>x</i>→∞ if the value if the values of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
approach <i>L</i> as <i>x</i> becomes sufficiently large. When you add –∞, the same statement holds,

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
except that you’re now taking <i>x</i> to be sufficiently large and negative. Then a line <i>y</i> = <i>L</i>

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:46,000
is a horizontal asymptote of the curve <i>y</i> = <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] if the limit of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] at ∞ or –∞ is <i>L</i>.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Here’s a plot for the function (<i>x</i>^2 + 1)/(<i>x</i>^2 – 1). When <i>x</i> approaches ∞ or –∞, the values of <i>y</i>

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
will approach 1. Roughly speaking, when <i>x</i> is very large, you get (<i>x</i>^2)/(<i>x</i>^2), which is 1.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay. Now let’s talk about the opposite behavior where you do not have a finite answer at ∞,

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you have infinite limits at ∞. Here’s a very simple example which we saw earlier on as well.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When you take the limit of 3<i>x</i> as it approaches ∞, the answer is ∞.

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Just the opposite happens at –∞, so the plot over here has no horizontal asymptotes.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay. Now one might talk about the laws of limits at ∞ just as before. You remember that

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
we have talked about mathematical laws that limits obey, and most of these laws

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
also apply to limits at ∞, but you must be a bit careful. The reason why you must be careful is that

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
now more than ever, you could have things which are both ∞, and when you try to cancel them,

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
you do not get back 0. Here’s an example. You have <i>x</i>^3 – <i>x</i>, and as <i>x</i>→∞, you get ∞ – ∞.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But that’s not 0, so you get back a False over here. But if you think of it as being ∞ * ∞,

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
then the answer really is ∞. Better still, you could think of this as being <i>x</i>^3

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
as very large compared to <i>x</i>, so the answer is ∞.

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay. A very important law which you can use for limits at infinity is the following.

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You look at the limit of (1/<i>x</i>)^<i>r</i> where <i>r</i> is some positive rational number,

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and if you assume that <i>r</i> is positive, then this limit is always 0. Just the same thing happens at –∞.

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You get back a 0 over there as well. For example, if you want the limit of 1/<i>x</i>^2

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
as <i>x</i> approaches either plus or minus infinity, the answer is just 0. This law is the basis of

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
lot of problem solving which we’ll see in the next few minutes. As my first example,

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
let’s take a rational function. If you want the limit at ∞, then notice that the highest power

42
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
in the numerator and denominator is <i>x</i>^2. You divide by that and use a function called Apart,

43
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
which will break apart the expressions. You see over here that as <i>x</i> approaches ∞,

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
by the previous law, both those terms give you 0, and both those terms give you 0 as well,

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
so the limit of the numerator is just 2—that’s the 2 from here—and the denominator,

46
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
the limit is just going to be 3. That’s the 3 from over there. To summarize, the limit of this

47
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
rather difficult-looking function is just 2/3 as <i>x</i>→∞.

48
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay. That’s the rational case, and now let’s take a case where you have the combination of

49
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
a radical and a rational. Okay. Now that’s your function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], and notice that the highest power

50
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
is <i>x</I> because you’ve got a square root of <i>x</i>^2 roughly, so if you divide by that, then you see that

51
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the numerator will have a limit of √5 as <i>x</i>→∞ and the denominator will have a limit of 2 as <i>x</i>→∞,

52
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
so those are the answers separately. Then if you divide them, you get the limit

53
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
for the entire radical rational expression.

54
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Finally, let’s take a pure radical. Here is a radical function. The problem is that as <i>x</i>→∞,

55
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
you roughly speaking get ∞ – ∞, and you cannot define that. What we do is we work with

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the conjugate radical and multiply <i>f</i> by it. You see over here that if we simplify it,

57
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the answer is just 4. In other words, the function is simply 4/(<i>x</I> + √(<i>x</i>^2 + 4)).

58
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
When <i>x</i> becomes very large, the denominator is much larger than the numerator, so the answer is 0

59
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
for the limit. You can confirm that with a plot. You see the limit approaches 0 as <i>x</i>→∞.

60
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay. How about compositions? Remember that if you have a composition of <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and you want to find the limit as <i>x</i>→<i>a</i>, then what you could do is take the limit inside the function <i>f</i>,

62
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
so to speak, provided that <i>f</i> is continuous and the limit exists. Here’s an example.

63
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You have a function Cos[1/<i>x</i>]. That’s the composition. If you look at the inner limit as <i>x</i>→∞,

64
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:32,000
then you get back 0. Then if you take the outer limit, you’ll get back a 1 because the cosine of 0 is 1.

65
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Here is a plot of the function, and you see that as <i>x</i> becomes very large, the function value approaches ∞.

66
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay. Now in the last two slides, I’ll talk about two shortcuts for computing

67
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
rational function limits at infinity. There are some special tricks which are

68
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
well worth knowing in this area. For example, if we have a rational function

69
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator like over here,

70
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
then then whether you are at ∞ or –∞, the answer is going to be 0 because the denominator grows

71
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
much more rapidly than the numerator. On the other hand, if the degrees agree

72
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
so the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator, then all that you do is

73
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
you look at the leading coefficients and you get back the answer 2/7 in both the cases over here.

74
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We’ve covered the case of when the degree is less for the numerator than the denominator

75
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and when they are both equal, but the really difficult case is when they are both

76
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
slightly different in the sense that the degree of the numerator is greater than

77
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the degree of the denominator. Now four things can happen. First of all, you have

78
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
a positive expression at ∞, so you have <i>x</I>^6 roughly at ∞ and <i>x</i>^2 over here.

79
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Then as you approach ∞, then both of these become ∞ because the difference

80
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
between the two degrees is even. If, on the other hand, you have a negative expression at infinity,

81
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
–2/3 roughly over here and –2/3 roughly over there, then the answer for both the limits will be –∞.

82
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Now on the other hand, if you have an odd difference for the degrees

83
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and the function is positive for larger values, then you see that the degree will affect the answer

84
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:10,000
in the sense that we have ∞ at ∞ and –∞ at –∞. After all, roughly speaking, there is <i>x</i>^9 over <i>x</i>^6.

85
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That’s <i>x</i>^3, so as <i>x</i> becomes large, you get ∞, and as <i>x</i> becomes very large and negative, you get –∞.

86
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Finally, if the function is negative for large values of <i>x</i>, then you see that

87
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
you get the opposite behavior. After all, when <i>x</i> is large, the negative sign becomes important.

88
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You get –∞ over here and ∞ over here. There are four combinations: both ∞; both –∞;

89
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and one of them ∞, one of them –∞; and then the other way around.

90
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So that’s the end of this lesson. The main point to note is that roughly the same laws hold

91
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
for limits at infinity as they do at individual points, but you have to be a bit more careful.

92
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There is a special rule which we saw earlier on for rational functional limits at infinity.

93
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Sometimes you may need to use a bit of algebra to tackle cases where there are radicals,

94
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and then multiplying by conjugates might help. In general, it’s really as easy to work at infinity

95
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
as it is with finite points. With what you’ve learned, the next lesson will talk about sketching curves.

96
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But before you do that, do review this lesson and look at the exercises and be ready for

97
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the next lesson on sketching curves. I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
