00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 20 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic of this lesson is curve sketching.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Suppose you have a function <i>f</i> like the one shown over here, <i>x</i>^2/(<i>x</i>^2 – 4).

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Then you can do several things. For example, you can work out the zeros of the function

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
simply by solving for <i>f</I>[<i>x</i>] = 0, and you find that they’re 0 at 0.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Or you could work out the vertical asymptotes simply by finding out whether

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the denominator <i>x</i>^2 – 4 is 0. Then we get the answer either –2 or 2.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Or you could work out the horizontal asymptotes by using the limit and letting <i>x</i> go to either ∞ or –∞,

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and you find that you actually have horizontal aymptotes, only at 1.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay. Now with all that information, you can plot by hand or, like I’ve done over here,

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
just use the Plot function to get back the same plot showing all the information.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
For example, there’s a 0 at 0, et cetera. The goal of this lesson is to help you to sketch functions

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
using derivatives and then perhaps use the Plot function to confirm that all your ideas are correct.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay. As a set of guidelines that you’ll require for today’s lesson, let’s make a list of things.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
First of all, when you want to sketch a function, you should find the domain of the function.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Where is the function defined? Next find the <i>x</i> and the <i>y</i> intercepts.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Where does it meet the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes? Next, is the function even? Is it odd? Is it periodic?

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If it’s any one of these, then of course everything becomes much simpler.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Now does the function have either a vertical or horizontal asymptote,

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
or perhaps even a slant asymptote? I haven’t told you what a slant asymptote is,

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but let’s take that for granted for now. Okay. Next find out the intervals where the function

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
either increases or decreases, and to do that, you could actually use the first derivative

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
of the function and then apply the increasing or decreasing test.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Next find the local maxima and minima, for which of course you will first find the critical numbers

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and then use either the first derivative test or the second derivative test.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Next you’ll want to check the concavity of the function, and for that you’ll use

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the second derivative of the function. Then if the second derivative is positive,

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
then you have a concave upward graph, and if it’s negative, then you have a concave downward graph.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Finally you might want to find the inflection points, and those are the points at which

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
either the second derivative is 0 and switches signs, or in some cases

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
it might not even be easy to calculate. With all that information,

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
you can then sketch your curve by hand, or as we’ll do over here, use the Plot function.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay. Let’s take an example now. Here is a rational function very similar to

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
the one we took earlier on: 3<i>x</i>^2/(<i>x</i>^2 – 4). Now of course this function is defined everywhere

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
except at –2 and 2, so the domain is those three pieces over here right up to –2,

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
then between –2 and 2, and then all the way from 2 to ∞, but not including either –2 or 2.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
To find the intercepts, you solve <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = 0 and also find the value of <i>f</i>[0], and you find that

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
those are the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> intercepts. Next we can check that the function is even simply by

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
equality testing over here, so <i>f</i>[–<i>x</i>] is the same as <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]. That’s clear from the function itself.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We have an <i>x</i>^2, so that’s an even function. Next we can work out the vertical asymptotes

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
at –2 and 2, and you can check that there’s a horizontal asymptote at <i>y</i> = 3.

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Having done that, we go on to the problem of finding out the critical points.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Critical points are the points at which <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>] is 0. You have one critical point, and the function is

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
not defined at 2 and –2, so in all, you have three critical points. What you do is you test

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the derivative on each part of the real line depending upon those. You take one point to the left of –2,

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
one point between –2 and 0, et cetera, and you find that you actually have

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
some positive and negative signs.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That says that the function is increasing on (–∞, 2) and (–2, 0) because those derivatives

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
are positive, and it’s decreasing on the other two parts over there because the first derivative

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is negative. Now the question is are there any local maxima or minima?

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, if you work out the second derivative at 0, then the answer is negative, so you do have

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
a local maximum at 0. The function has no inflection points, as you can check for solving <i>f</i>''[<i>x</i>] = 0,

54
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and then you can also check that it is concave upward between (–∞, 2) and (2, ∞)

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and concave downward between the two values. That’s the information about

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
inflection points and the concavity. Finally you can put that all together and get a nice plot

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
of a function which shows all the information that we gathered earlier on.

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay. A second example. Let’s take a slightly harder function which is trigonometric.

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You’ve got Sin[<i>x</i>]/(2 + Cos[<i>x</i>]). Now that’s never problematic because

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the denominator never becomes 0, so the domain is all the real numbers. The question is

61
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
what are the intercepts? Well, you solve for <i>f</I> equal to 0 and find the value at <i>f</i>[0],

62
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and you get back that in fact, it’s going to be multiples of π for the <i>x</i> intercepts

63
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
because that’s where the sine function is 0, and the <i>y</i> intercept is just at 0.

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay. That conditional expression over here is telling you the condition for there to be an <i>x</i> intercept.

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Next the function is certainly odd and periodic because the sine function is odd.

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Because it’s periodic, you can afford to look at the interval  [0, 2π],

67
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and that’s quite an equality. The function has no vertical asymptotes

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
because the denominator is never problematic, and there are horizontal asymptotes

69
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
at no points because the limits don’t even exist; they are intervals.

70
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay. Now the question is what are the critical points? Well, if you check between 0 and 2π,

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
you find two critical points, and then if you take sample points, then you find out that

72
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
in fact your have an increasing behavior between (0, 2π/3) and (4π/3, 2π)

73
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and decreasing between those two values. That’s the information about the first derivative,

74
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and that’s going to tell you that you have a local maximum at 2π/3 and a local minimum at 4π/3.

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can check that with the second derivative. You have a negative second derivative at

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the first point and a positive second derivative at the second point, so you have a local maximum

77
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
in the first case and a local minimum in the second case. Finally you can check there are

78
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
inflection points at 0, π and 2π by solving for the second derivative equal to 0.

79
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now the concavity test can be applied, and you see that you actually have

80
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
a concave upward behavior on (π, 2π) and a concave downward behavior on (0, π).

81
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Now we can put that all together and get this plot of the function, which shows all the earlier information.

82
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Now I haven’t really spoken about slant asymptotes in the course earlier on,

83
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
but let’s define a slant asymptote. A slant asymptote is a line such that the limit of <i>f</i>

84
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
approaches <i>mx</i> + <i>b</i> where <i>mx</i> + <i>b</i> is the right-hand side for the line.

85
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Basically the graph of the function approaches that straight line, but that straight line

86
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
may not be vertical or horizontal. Okay. Now the question is how do you find the slant asymptotes?

87
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Luckily if you have a rational function, then slant asymptotes can occur only when

88
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator.

89
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
In that case, you can simply use polynomial long division. You can work out the quotient.

90
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
For example, over here you have the function (<i>x</i>^2 + 1)/<i>x</i>. Then if you find the quotient,

91
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the answer is just <i>x</i>, so <i>y</i> = <i>x</i> is a slant asymptote. You can check that with the plot,

92
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and you see that you have a slant asymptote at <i>y</i> = <i>x</i> over here.

93
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
With that information, we can now take up a slant asymptote problem

94
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and try and draft the function 2<i>x</i>^3/(<i>x</i>^2 + 2). The function is defined everywhere;

95
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
no problem at all. The denominator is never zero, so the domain is all the real numbers.

96
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The <i>x</i> and the <i>y</i> intercepts are both at 0. That’s easy to show. It’s certainly an odd function.

97
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It’s an odd function because we have an <i>x</i>^3 over there.

98
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There are no vertical or horizontal asymptotes, but you do have a slant asymptote

99
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
that you can work out by division, and you see over here that actually

100
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the function does approach 2<i>x</i> as <i>x</i>→∞, so that is a slant asymptote for this example.

101
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay. Now the question is when is the first derivative 0? You put 0 in; you are at 0.

102
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can check that. If you take sample points at –1 and 1, then you have an increasing function

103
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
between (–∞, 0) and (0, ∞). The first derivative test tells you that there are

104
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
no local maxima or minima. The second derivative test doesn’t tell you anything

105
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
because the second derivative of 0 is 0. It looks like there might be some inflection points,

106
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and sure enough, there are three inflection points over here: at 0, √6 and –√6.

107
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can check that it’s concave upward on two intervals and concave downward on two others.

108
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You have a positive derivative over here and you have a positive derivative over there

109
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
for the second derivative. In that case, you have a concave upward behavior,

110
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and the reverse happens in the other two cases. With all that information,

111
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
one can plot this rather complicated function, and that is the plot showing the asymptote <i>y</i> = 2<i>x</i>.

112
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of this lesson. What we’ve learned is that we can use

113
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
many of the properties that we’ve learned earlier on to sketch the graph of the function.

114
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
For example, the intercepts will determine where the function is 0 or where it crosses the <i>y</i> axis.

115
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Of course to find the asymptotes, you would just use the limit function.

116
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
To find local maxima and minima, you would use the first and second derivatives,

117
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and you can also find inflection points and intervals of increase or decrease.

118
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
All of that information together will let you get a nice sketch of your function.

119
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
In the next lesson we’ll be talking about optimization problems, but before we do that,

120
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
do practice curve sketching—it’s an important topic—and be ready for the next lesson.

121
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
