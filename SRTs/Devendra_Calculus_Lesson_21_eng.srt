00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 21 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is optimization.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We’ve learned how to find extreme values—maxima and minima—earlier on,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and those have been very useful in applications.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now we’ve also learned that those derivatives in maxima and minima

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
can be used to do things like maximize profits or minimize costs,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so they have quite a few very practical uses.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This lesson will continue the approach learned earlier on

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to solve some more optimization problems.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So it’s just a continuation of all the earlier work,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but this time around, we’ll develop a way for solving optimization problems.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We’ll set up a set of guidelines that should help us solve these problems in a systematic way.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay. Here are those guidelines.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Number one: make sure you understand the problem, perhaps by reading it more than once.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Next make a picture to get an idea of what you need to do in the problem.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Next assign a symbol like <i>M</i> to the quantity that is being maximized or minimized,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and of course do the same thing for all the other unknown quantities.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now use all the information to set up an expression for <i>M</i> in terms of all the other variables.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Another difficulty is that if you have multiple symbols,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
then you will need to find relationships so that <i>M</i> is a function of just one variable <i>x</i>.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
After all, we’re doing single-variable calculus,

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
so you must have just one variable <i>x</I> on which <i>M</i> depends.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
One last thing is find the domain of <i>f</i>.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Find out where <i>f</i> is defined because that will tell you the interval

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
on which you must find the maxima and minima.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
For the final step, you find the absolute maximum and minimum of <i>f</i>

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
using all that you’ve learned in earlier lessons.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let’s begin with an example.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A farmer has 3,600 feet of fencing,

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and this farmer wants to build a rectangular field that borders a river,

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but he doesn’t want to put any fencing on the side touching the river.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The question is find the dimensions of the field that maximize the area.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now for the first step, let’s do an animation.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Here’s the area for particular values of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let’s begin by starting all the way to the left over here, and let’s play the animation.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You see over here that initially the area increases, and then it starts to drop.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In other words, your configuration can neither be too thin, nor can it be too tall.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In fact, here’s a picture you have of the problem.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You have the area over here depending upon <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, the length and the width of the field.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay. Let’s now start solving the problem.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The area is going to be <i>x</i> times <i>y</i>, which is the length times the width.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The problem is you have two variables, so you must eliminate one of them,

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
but then you know 2<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> must be the length of the fencing available—after all, <i>y</i> occurs only once.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Replace <i>y</i> by an expression involving <i>x</i>, and then the area depends only on one variable, <i>x</i>.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Now the point is that you cannot have the value of <i>x</i> exceeding 1,800

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
because otherwise the area would be less than 0 because that factor becomes negative.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So the domain of the function is from 0 to 1,800.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then finally, let’s use the closed interval method like I’m doing over here

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to find the critical points, and then here is the area at that value of <i>x</i>.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Another point is that you only have a single critical point,

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and at the end points you have either a 0 area, which makes no sense,

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
or you have this maximum area over here, so you have a maximum at this value of <i>x</i> over here.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So the rectangle should be 900 feet long and 1,800 feet wide.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay. Before going on, we need to talk a little bit about absolute extreme values.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Earlier on, we mostly talked about local extreme values.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The point is that if you have a critical number <i>c</i> for a function and you find that the derivative is,

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
let’s say, positive to the left of it for all values and negative to the right of it for all values,

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
then that value is actually an absolute maximum for the function.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In just the same way, if you have a value <i>c</i> for which the derivative is

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
negative for all values to the left and positive for all values to the right,

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
then you have an absolute minimum.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That’s just a slightly more general result than the first derivative test.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We have tweaked that test slightly to find aboslute maxima and minima

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
instead of local maxima and minima.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
As a very simple example, here’s <i>x</I>^2 with its derivative 2<i>x</i>.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You see over here that that’s the minimum, and to the left the derivative is negative,

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and to the right it’s positive for all values, so you actually have an absolute minimum over here.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
As an application, now let’s take up the problem of making a cylindrical can

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
that holds 1 liter of water, and you want to find the dimensions

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
that will minimize the total cost of plastic that’s used to make the can.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now if you want to minimize the cost of plastic,

73
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
then the best way to do that is to minimize the surface area of the can.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Here is the can itself.

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That’s the surface area <i>S</i>, the radius and the height.

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The formula for the area is just the area of the two sides and the two bases,

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
so that’s the total area. Now you want to eliminate <i>h</i>, let’s say,

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
so remember that the volume π<i>r</I>^2<i>h</i> is 1,000.

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
After all, you have 1 liter of water, so <i>h</I> is 1,000/(π<i>r</i>^2).

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Having done that, we can now write the surface area in terms of just one variable <i>r</i>,

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and the domain is just from 0 all the way to ∞.

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In principle, you could have any value for <i>r</i>.

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now the point is you cannot apply the closed interval method because the interval is infinite,

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
so what we do is we first of all work out the critical numbers.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There’s just one critical number, but then you note that

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to the left of that value you have the derivative being negative,

87
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and to the right you have it being positive, so actually you have an absolute minimum.

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay. Now with that radius, you can work out the height using the solution above,

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
this 5.41926, and that says that the radius should be approximately 5.42

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and the height should be approximately 10.84.

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay. Now a problem about distances.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You want to find the point on the parabola <i>y</i>^2 = 2<i>x</i> which is closest to the point (1, 32).

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That’s the distance formula.

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You have √(<i>x</I> – 1)^2 + (<i>y</i> – 32)^2 for that point.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Because the point lies on the parabola, you have <i>x</i> = <i>y</i>^2/2 from here,

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
so you plug it back and you get a distance function.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Now I won’t worry about the square root sign. That doesn’t matter.

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You work out the critical numbers, and you find that it’s just one critical number.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you look at the derivative, you actually see that

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the derivative is going to be negative to the left of 4 and positive to the right of 4,

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
so you actually have an absolute minimum.

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The minimum value will occur when you are at (8, 4), and that’s the answer to the problem.

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay. Now on to a business example.

104
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let’s say you have a store that sells 300 monitors a week at $200 each.

105
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now the store finds that for each $10 rebate, of course the sales go up,

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
so the number of monitors increases by the number 30 in a week.

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay. The question is what are the demand function and the revenue function?

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You also want to find the rebate that the store should offer to maximize its revenue.

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The demand function is just the price per unit, so that’s given over here.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You have the base price 200 minus the discount that customers will get

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
depending upon how many monitors are sold.

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The revenue function is just the total revenue.

113
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That’s the number of items times the price per item.

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
To maximize revenue, you simply find its critical value, which is 450,

115
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and then you can actually check quite easily that you actually have

116
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
an absolute maximum at this value.

117
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The price at this value of <i>x</i> is 150.

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Now the rebate should be $200, the base price, minus $150. That’s $50.

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay. Now that’s all done manually, but in the Wolfram Language,

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
we have two functions, Maximize and Minimize, which can actually find

121
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
these absolute maxima and minima for a given range without any effort on our part.

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
For example, in the earlier case, I could use Maximize to get back

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
just the same answer for the revenue.

124
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You could also specify range, and we get back the answer for that range.

125
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That’s Maximize, and similarly, you could find an absolute minimum

126
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
by using the Minimize function.

127
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Here is a function and you want to minimize it between 0 and 2π,

128
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
so you use Minimize and you get back an answer,

129
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and here is a plot showing that that answer is actually correct.

130
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That dot over here is the point at which you have a minimum.

131
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay. That’s the end of this lesson.

132
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The main point is that optimization is a very important area of applied mathematics.

133
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
A lot of people spend time just solving optimization problems.

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now to solve such problems, the first point is you must try and understand what the problem is.

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
To understand the problem, you draw a picture, et cetera,

136
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and make you’ve got all of it set up right before you try and solve it.

137
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Of course, if you are in business, then optimization is particularly important

138
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
because you want maximize the profits,

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
so you need some kind of quantitative way of maximizing profits.

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There are two built-in functions, Maximize and Minimize,

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
which are really useful for solving such problems.

142
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The next lesson will talk about antiderivatives,

143
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
but before you do that, do review today’s lesson.

144
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It was quite a difficult lesson.

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Make sure you understand all the steps, and then we’ll go on to antiderivatives next time.

146
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
