00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 22 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is antiderivatives.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So far, we have been talking about derivatives of functions.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, the derivative of 3<i>x</i> with respect to <i>x</i> is just 3.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now let’s say you want to go backward.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You want to find a function whose derivative is 3.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now of course in this case, you already know that 3<i>x</i> is the answer, or it is an answer,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but in this lesson, we’ll go over that for many different kinds of functions.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This idea of going back has many applications.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For example, if you’re given the particle’s velocity function in a problem,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
you could go out and work out the position of a particle.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That’s the main theme for today,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to try and go backward and figure out a function whose derivative is a given expression.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That’s the topic of antiderivatives.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The function with a given derivative <i>f</i> is called the antiderivative of <i>f</i>.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now let’s take <i>f</i> equal to <i>x</i>.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The question is what is its antiderivative?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Then what you could do is you could actually use the power rule, but you do it in reverse.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You have <i>x</I>^2, so increase the exponent by one to get the <i>x</i>^2,

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and then you would divide by the new exponent, so the answer is <i>x</i>^2/2.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But that’s only one possible answer you’ll see soon.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let’s confirm with D, and you’ll see that the derivative of <i>x</i>^2/2 is indeed <i>x</i>.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We have found an antiderivative of <i>x</I>, and that’s <i>x</i>^2/2.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Here’s a plot of <i>x</i> and the antiderivative.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay. This is the function, and that’s the antiderivative we found out.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now we said over here that <i>x</i>^2/2 is an antiderivative of <i>x</i>,

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and that’s because every function has more than one antiderivative.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For example, in our case,  <i>x</i>^2/2 + 1 is also an antiderivative.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In general, if you have one antiderivative,

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you have many more by simply adding arbitrary constants.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This expression over here gives you a family of antiderivatives.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Here’s a plot to show that for the function we just talked about, the function <i>x</i>:

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you have <i>x</i> over here, the function, and all those curves are antiderivatives for <i>x</i>.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Notice that each of them is simply a vertical shift of <i>x</i>^2/2 either up or down.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay. Some rules for antiderivatives.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The antiderivative of a sum is the sum of the antiderivatives.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
For example, if you want to work out the antiderivative of <i>x</i>^2 + <i>x</i>^3,

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
then you would work out the first answer, which is <i>x</i>^3/3, the second one, <i>x</i>^4/4,

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and then you add the constant <i>c</i> and you’re done.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That’s the way to find the antiderivatives of a sum.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Next if you have a difference,

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
then you can simply work out the antiderivatives of each term

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and then find the difference of those antiderivatives.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
For example, if you have 5 – <i>x</i>^4,

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
then the answer is 5<i>x</i> from the 5 and <i>x</i>^5/5 from the <i>x</i>^4.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That’s the proof that the answer is correct.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
These rules correspond to the sum and difference laws for differentiation.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We also have a constant multiple law which says that

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
if you want to work out the antiderivative of <i>kF</i>'[<i>x</i>], then the answer is <i>kF</i>[<i>x</i>] + <i>C</i>.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now in just the same way, there are rules for products and quotients,

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
but they are much harder to use.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay. How about trig functions?

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let’s say you have the trig functions over here, the six basic ones—

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant and cotangent—and those are the derivatives.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
For example, if you want to work out the antiderivative of Sec[<i>x</i>]Tan[<i>x</i>].

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You look back over there, and the answer is Sec[<i>x</i>] from here plus the constant <i>C</i>.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Here is a table of all those antiderivatives.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The antiderivative of cosine is sine, et cetera.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now of course in each case, you must put the +<i>C</i> at the end,

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
but I haven’t done that in this table.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay. As an example of how we can apply all this knowledge,

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
let’s try and find the general antiderivative of the function <i>f</i> over here.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You have a sum over here, so you can apply the sum rule,

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and you see that the antiderivative of 3Sin[<i>x</i>] is –3Cos[<i>x</i>] + <i>C</i>.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let’s check that. That’s correct.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then what you do is you break up this over here into two terms by writing it as a difference.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You simply separate out the terms and then you work out the antiderivative separately,

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
so you get 4<i>x</i>^5/5 + <i>C</i> for the first term,

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and –<i>x</i>^–1/2 has the antiderivative –<i>x</i>^1/2/(–1/2) + <i>C</i>.

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The complete antiderivative is over here.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Here’s a check that each part is correct

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
so you can find the complete answer for the whole expression

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
by simply adding things together,

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and here’s a verification that everything is correct.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
In general, you will need to combine rules to get the answer for the full problem.

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay. These antiderivatives are very useful for solving differential equations.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are these? They are equations that involve derivatives.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Now in general, it’s pretty difficult to solve differential equations,

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but one can solve some simple ones with what we’ve learned so far.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
For example, if I said solve the equation <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>√<i>x</i> where <i>f</i>[1] = 3,

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
then what you would do is you would first work out the antiderivative over here,

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and then we’ll apply the condition <i>f</i>[1] = 3.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The antiderivative in this case is 2<i>x</i>^(5/2)/5 + <i>C</i>.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let’s check that. Then you want to find the value of <i>C</i>.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What you do is you plug in <i>x</i> = 1 in the equation—remember that <i>f</i>[1] is 3—

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and work out the value of <i>C</i>. You have that the required solution,

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the particular solution, is (2<i>x</i>^(5/2) + 13)/5.

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Now of course we have a very nice function in the Wolfram Language called DSolve

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
which will do that for you automatically, but before that,

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
let’s just clear the function <i>f</i> because we defined it earlier on and call DSolve,

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and you get back just the same answer.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That’s the differential equation, that’s the condition <i>f</i>[1] = 3,

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and you simply want to solve for <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] with variable <i>x</i>,

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and DSolve will do that for you quite easily.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay. A slightly harder example.

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let’s take a second-order differential equation where you have a second derivative over here.

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You’re given <i>f</i>'' and two conditions, <i>f</i>[0] and <i>f</i>[1].

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What you do is you first of all work out <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>] by one antiderivative computation,

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and you get 4<i>x</i>^3 – 3<i>x</i>^2 – 8<i>x</i> + <i>C</i>. Let’s check that.

101
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then what you do is you start with the expression over here

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and work out its antiderivative and you get another answer, so the answer over here.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay. Then you want to solve for <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>,

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
so you take the expression from there and you plug in the values given to you,

105
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and you find the value of <i>c</i> is 5 and the value of <i>d</i> is 1.

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You’ve worked out a particular solution as shown over here.

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Of course, you can do all that with DSolve automatically

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and get back the same answer as you did by hand.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay. Now an application to physics.

110
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let’s say you’re given the acceleration of a particle as 6<i>t</i>^2 – 10,

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and you’re given that the velocity at time <i>t</i>[0] = –4 and the position at that time is 3.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You want to work out the position function.

113
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
For the first step, you work out the velocity by antidifferentiation as 2<i>t</i>^3 – 10<i>t</i> + <i>C</i>.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Here’s a check for that.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Then you work out the position function by one more antidifferentiation.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Here’s a check for that, and then you apply the given conditions

117
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
because you want to work out <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> over here. So <i>v</i>[0] = –4, <i>s</i>[0] = 3.

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You plug in those values, and you find that you actually have <i>C</i> goes to –4 and <i>D</i> goes to 3,

119
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
so that’s the solution for the problem;

120
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:37,000
namely, that you have an expression with <i>t</i>^4/2 – 5<i>t</i>^2 – 4<i>t</i> + 3.

121
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Now you can use the same method but automatically by calling DSolve,

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and you find you get the same answer.

123
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of today’s lesson.

124
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The main point is that the antiderivative of a function is a function <i>g</i> such that <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>] = <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>].

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Now these antiderivatives come in families.

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You don’t always just get one;

127
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
you get lots of them, so you always add an arbitrary constant, +<i>C</i>.

128
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can find them by using the usual differentiation rules, but you need to go in reverse.

129
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now the most important application in practice

130
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
is to solve differential equations using these antiderivatives.

131
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Given a differential equation, you can solve it,

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
but if you’re given some extra conditions,

133
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
you can actually work out a particular solution for that differential equation.

134
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Finally these antiderivatives are really useful in physics

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
when you want to analyze the one-dimensional motion of a particle.

136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
With that, we are now ready to go on into what is called integral calculus.

137
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What we’ve done so far is called differential calculus.

138
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about integral calculus,

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
but before we do that, do make sure you’ve gone through today’s lesson

140
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and you’re ready to take on the next topic, which is integral calculus.

141
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
