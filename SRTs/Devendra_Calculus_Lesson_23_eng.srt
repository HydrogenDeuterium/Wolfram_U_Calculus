00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 23 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The topic for this lesson is Riemann sums.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Basically there are two fundamental aspects of calculus.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first aspect is differential calculus,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and that’s what we’ve been talking about all the time so far.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now the prime motivation over there is to find the slope of a curve at a point of the tangent line.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now the second aspect of calculus is the so-called integral calculus,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and that is what we’ll cover from now on.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now the basic motivation, the prime motivation for this part of calculus is quite simple.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Basically here is a plot of this function, and the problem is that

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you’d like to find this area under the curve for the function.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In this lesson, what we’ll do is we’ll devise a precise way

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
of expressing this notion of area under the curve mathematically.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay. Let’s begin with some review of your earlier work.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If you have a rectangle, then its area is length times width.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
On the other hand, if it were a triangle, then its area is base times height over 2.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But if you have a general polygon, what you’d do is you’d break it up into triangles,

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
then find the area of each one triangle and then add them all together.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now the area of a circle is a bit harder because it involves the number π,

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but that’s straightforward to work with.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The question now is what happens if you have a more general curve?

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let’s say you have this parabola, and you want to find the area under the parabola.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How do you work it out?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
To motivate our discussion, let’s recall the idea of the slope at a point.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let’s say if you have a differentiable function, then the slopes of

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the secant lines at a point will eventually approach some value <i>m</i>,

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
which is the slope of the tangent at that point.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here’s an example to illustrate that.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You have a curve <i>x</i>^2 and you have a point (1, 1) on it,

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and you want to work out the slope at that point.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
At the moment, the slope is 3.618 for the secant,

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but what I’ll do now is I’ll try and bring the point <i>Q</i> closer to <i>P</i>,

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and as I bring it closer, the value of the slope

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
approaches the correct value, which is eventually 2.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That’s the idea of slope at a point.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You take secant lines, and then you take the limit of those lines

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
as you approach the point.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A similar idea can be used for areas; namely, break up the areas

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
into separate rectangles, and then you add up all those rectangle areas

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and then you get an approximate area for the region.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
For example, if you take the same curve and you break it up

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
into four rectangles over here, then you see that the area approximately,

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but of course a wide space tells you that

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
there is some error in the approximation.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now if you take more rectangles—let’s say you take 10 rectangles—

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
you will get a better approximation, and then as you increase

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the number of rectangles, you will get a better and better approximation, hopefully.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That’s the idea of area which we want to explore.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let’s begin now with a parabola again and try and work with rectangles

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
which have the top-left corner at the point on the curve.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What you see here is that in this case, you actually have

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
an underestimation of the total area, so the answer which you get is less than the total area.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
For example,  in this case your corners are at 0, 0.2, et cetera,

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and you can work out the area.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Then you get back the answer, 0.21875.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Those over here are just the function values.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay. On the other hand, if you took the top-right corner for each rectangle,

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
then you can see you’re going to overestimate the area under the curve,

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
so in this case you get back the answer, 0.46875.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It looks like the answer would lie somewhere between 0.21875 and 0.46875.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That’s the conclusion from the earlier slide which I am repeating over here again.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What happens as you increase the number of rectangles?

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, you see over here that as you have a larger and larger number

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
of rectangles, then the lower and the upper estimates become closer and closer,

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and they are almost identical eventually.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The plots over here show you what’s happening over here.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
As you have a larger number of rectangles,

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you get a better and better approximation to the area,

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and finally it looks like you actually get the area.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But that only happens when you take a limit.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The area will approach 1/3, but that will only actually happen if you take a limit.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Here’s a required limit. 1/<i>n</i> is the width of each rectangle,

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and that’s the functional value, the height.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The limit over here is 1/3—that’s the upper limit—and the lower limit

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
would be to take the other end of the rectangle,

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and then you get back 1/3 as the answer in this case as well.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay. Now to get a bit more general, I need to talk about so-called Riemann sums.

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now this is a fairly difficult concept, so let me go slowly.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let’s say you have a general function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], not just a parabola,

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and you want to work out the area under the curve between [<i>a</I>, <i>b</i>].

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What you do is you first break it up into <i>n</i> rectangles

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
so each rectangle will have a width (<i>b</I> – <i>a</i>)/<i>n</i>.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This quantity is called Δ<i>x</i>. Δ means very small.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now you’ve broken up your interval [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>] into <i>n</i> smaller intervals,

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
[<i>x</i>0, <i>x</i>1], [<i>x</i>1, <i>x</i>2], et cetera, and the left endpoint is <i>a</i>, the right endpoint is <i>b</i>.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
For each subinterval, you have the endpoints given by just adding Δ<i>x</i> every time.

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What you see over here is the area of any one rectangle

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
will be the width of the rectangle times the height.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let’s say if you work with the right-aligned rectangles,

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
then that height will be <i>f</i>[<i>xi</i>].

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That’s the total area, the sum, but if you work out the left-aligned rectangles,

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
then you get a similar sum, but with <i>xi</i> – 1 as the point which you evaluate.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
These sums are called Riemann sums because

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
they were discovered by the famous German mathematician Bernhard Riemann.

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Here’s an example that shows what’s happening.

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You have the curve Sin[<i>x</i>] + 2, and you want to see what happens

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
as you increase the number of rectangles.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let’s play the animation.

100
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You see that you get a better limit approximation

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
as you increase the number of rectangles.

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But of course, things are not so simple because at some places,

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you get a slightly smaller area, and at some others,

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you overestimate the area.

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay. Now we can make a formal definition of area.

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The area under the curve is defined by

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the limit of the sum of the areas of the rectangles.

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now that’s the case for right-aligned because you’re working with <i>f</i>[<i>xi</i>],

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
but if you want left-aligned rectangles, then you get almost the same expression,

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but now you start at 0 rather than starting at 1.

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The fact is that if your function <i>f</i> is continuous,

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
then both those limits will exist, and in fact, they’ll be equal.

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You could work with those sums, or you could actually take the values

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
at any number in the subinterval for each <i>i</i>.

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
These numbers are called sample points.

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In particular, if you have right-aligned rectangles,

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
then you have the sample points <i>xi</i>, and if you have left-aligned rectangles,

118
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
then you have the sample points <i>xi</i> – 1.

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That’s the general formula for the area

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
with any sample points for each subinterval.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
For example, here you have taken the sample points

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to be the midpoints of each subinterval.

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay. Now it’s time to work out an example,

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
so let’s try to work out the area of Sin[<i>x</i>] from 0 to <i>b</i>

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
where the number <i>b</i> lies between 0 and π.

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Here’s a plot. Now we break up the interval into <i>n</i> subintervals.

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We’ll work with, let’s say, right-aligned rectangles,

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and you get the answer for the area as 1 – Cos[<i>b</i>].

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Of course, you could then replace the <i>b</i> with π,

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and you get back a much nicer answer, which is just 2.

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That’s the power of the whole method; namely, it gives the exact answer

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
under this curve between, in this case, 0 and π.

133
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay. Now a slightly more practical problem.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let’s say a car moves on a highway, and you’re given the velocities

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
at different times at 10-minute intervals, and you want to work out

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the total distance covered in 100 minutes.

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What you do is you divide by 60 over here—

138
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
after all, you want to work with minutes—and you take the height,

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
so to speak, as the velocities, so you take 63, 62, 61, et cetera, from here,

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and you get back the sum, which is just the distance covered.

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You can also take the heights to be the velocities at the right endpoints

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
like I’ve done over here, in which case you get back the answer 108.33.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That’s a plot of the velocities, and we’ve worked out distance in two ways

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
using the left values and the right values.

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But of course we could be more precise and assume that the velocity

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
is given by a certain function, in which case you could work out

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the distance by a similar method as earlier on.

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You take the limit of the sum, and then velocities must be then

149
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
found out at those values over here.

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Then you get back the answer as 109.394 in this case.

151
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That’s a plot of velocity, and the area under the curve in this case

152
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
will give you the distance covered in that interval of time.

153
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson.

154
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Basically, finding area is a very practical matter.

155
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You’ve done it forever, so to speak,

156
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
from, let’s say, middle school all the way up.

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But to work out the area under a general curve,

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you must divide into rectangles and then add those areas up.

159
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Finally, we are doing calculus, so you must take the limit

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
as those rectangle numbers approach infinity,

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and then you get the real area under the curve.

162
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Now, these sums that you compute are called Riemann sums

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
in honor of the mathematician Riemann,

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and these Riemann sums can also be used to work out

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the total distance traveled when you are given only the velocity.

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That’s the end of this lesson.

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The next lesson will talk about Riemann sums in more detail,

168
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
but before doing that, there will be a problem session,

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
which you should certainly look at and understand the topic in much greater detail.

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
