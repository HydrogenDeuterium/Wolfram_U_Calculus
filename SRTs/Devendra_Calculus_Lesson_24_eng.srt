00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 24 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic of this lesson is the definite integral.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In the previous lesson, we talked about the Riemann sum

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the limit of said sum for a function <i>f</I>[<i>x</i>].

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Usually we picked <i>f</i> to be positive, and if we did that,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
then one could interpret the sum as being

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the area under the curve corresponding to <i>f</i>.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But there is a slight problem to this approach

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because the Riemann sum has lots of practical applications,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
such as finding the area under the velocity curve.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here’s an example.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That’s the velocity of a particle, let’s say.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Here’s a plot.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then the area under this curve can be interpreted as

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the total distance traveled by the particle,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in this case from 0 to 5 seconds, let’s say.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now the question is what happens if <i>f</i> is negative?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
After all, the velocity of a particle can be

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
either positive or negative depending upon the direction.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That’s the question that we want to answer in this lesson,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and then we will talk about some properties of the Riemann sum.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let’s begin with a definition.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Because we use Riemann sums so often,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
we have given it a special name in mathematics.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It’s called the definite integral.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In fact, there is also a special notation

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
for that rather cumbersome Riemann sum.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It’s just called integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> <i>f</i>(<i>x</I>)<i>d</i>(<i>x</i>).

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That over there, that elongated S, is the definite integral sign

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
with <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, the limits, at both the ends.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The S over here, like I said,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
is just the elongated S standing for “sum”.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
When you find the area under a function curve from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>,

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
we’ll say that we are integrating the function from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Luckily the Wolfram Language has

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
a very nice built-in function that integrates these functions,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and it’s called Integrate.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Integrate is the function that you’d use

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to compute these definite integrals.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
For example, let’s look at <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2, and you want to integrate,

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
let’s say, from 0 to 1.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here’s a Riemann sum and the limit, and you get back the answer 1/3.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you could just as well use

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the Integrate symbol that’s over here.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You integrate from 0 to 1 for <i>x</i>^2,

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and you get back just the same answer, 1/3.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Integrate is the function to use

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
when you want to do definite integration.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now, the point is that not every function is integrable.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Not every function can be integrated, and that’s because

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the limit in the Riemann sum may not converge to a finite value.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Here’s an example.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = 1/<i>x</i> and you’re trying to find the integral.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Notice over here I’m using the full text over here for Integrate

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
rather than the symbol, and it says over here that this integral

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
does not converge on 0 to 1, and that’s because

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
the graph shows that in fact you have an ∞ near 0

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because 1/<i>x</i> becomes infinite as you approach 0 from the right.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Luckily in this lesson, we’ll talk about

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
functions which can be integrated as long as you’re careful.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In general, one has the property that a function is integrable

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
if it is continuous—no breaks in the graph—

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
or it has only a finite number of jump discontinuities.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
In this case, the point is you actually have

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
an infinite discontinuity at 0, and that’s a real problem.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to talking about functions which have

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
a negative function value.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
For example, you have the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = –<i>x</i>,

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and you want find its area.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well the point is because it’s negative,

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
what you do is you find the area from 0 to 1

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
as if it’s a normal triangle that’s 1/2,

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and then you get the minus sign, and you get the answer, –1/2.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
if you use integrate, you get back just the same result,

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
–1/2, for this integral.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay. Next point over here is what happens if you have a function

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
which is both positive and negative.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let’s take a sine function.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now we see what happens over here is that the function is

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
sometimes positive and sometimes negative.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It’s positive from 0 to π, and then negative from π to 2π.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In this case, what you’ll do is you’ll add

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
all the areas above the <i>x</i> axis

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and then you subtract the sum of the areas below the <i>x</i> axis,

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and you get back the net area.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now in this case, of course, we have a positive area

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and a negative area, and the net area is 0.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let’s check that over here with Integrate,

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and you do get back the answer is 0 for this area.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay. On to some properties of definite integrals.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If you work out the integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> of a function,

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
then that’s the negative of the area from <i>b</i> to <i>a</i>.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
For example, if you work out the integral of <i>x</i>^2 from 1 to 0,

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that’s the negative of the area from 0 to 1,

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
so you have a –1/3 over here and 1/3 over there.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In particular, if <i>a</i> = <i>b</i>, then you have

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
something which is negative itself, so the area in this case

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is just 0, and that makes sense

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
because there’s no area between <i>a</i> and <i>a</i> to compute.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In our particular case, if you take the integral of <i>f</i> from 1 to 1,

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
then you get back 0 as expected.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay. Properties two.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You see over here that if you have a constant function

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and you find the integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>,

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
then you just get back the constant value times (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>).

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If you have a sum of functions, then the integral is

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the sum of <i>f</i> integral and the <i>g</i> integral.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For a difference, the integral of <i>f</i> – <i>g</i>

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is the integral of <i>f</i> minus the integral of <i>g</i>.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Finally, you can always pull out constants

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
from inside integral signs and save yourself some computation.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
For the first property, for example, if you want to find

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
the area from, let’s say, 1 to 5 for the function

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
with constant height 5, then the answer is just going to be 20.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
After all, you have 5 times 4, which is equal to 20.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay. The final set of properties is that

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
if you have three points <i>a</i>, <i>b</I> and <i>c</i>

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and you want to work out the area from <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>,

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you work out the integral from <i>a</I> to <i>b</i> and then <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>,

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and you get back the area from <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now obviously if a function is non-negative,

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
then the area also will be non-negative,

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and if <i>f</i> is larger than <i>g</i>, then the integral of of <i>f</i>

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
will be larger than the integral of <i>g</i>.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
One last point: if <i>f</i> is kind of sandwiched between

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the limits <i>m</i> and the capital <i>M</i> over here,

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
then the area for <i>f</i> will be sandwiched between the area

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
for a rectangle with sides <i>m</i>(<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and a larger rectangle with sides <i>M</i>(<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>).

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Here’s a picture.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That’s the function <i>f</i>, and the area under <i>f</i>

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
is sandwiched between the areas of those two rectangles.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
To summarize, we have given a new name to Riemann sums.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You now call them definite integrals.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
These definite integrals have many nice special properties

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
which makes them easy to compute.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The nice thing about the definite integral is it can handle

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
functions with both positive values and negative values,

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and then you might get answers which are positive

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
or negative or even 0.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We have a very nice function in the Wolfram Language

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
which does the work for you.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It’s called Integrate, and that is

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
a very popular, well-used function in the language.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In the next lesson we’ll talk about

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the so-called fundamental theorem of calculus,

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
which connects the two branches of calculus,

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
integral calculus and differential calculus, together.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But before we do that, do review this lesson, go over the exercises

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and be ready for the fundamental theorem of calculus.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
