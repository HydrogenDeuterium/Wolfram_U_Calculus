00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 25 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The topic for this lesson is the fundamental theorem of calculus.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So far in this course, we have talked about differential calculus

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and a bit of integral calculus.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now originally, differential calculus arose in the problem of

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
finding the tangent line to a curve like you see over here—

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
a sine curve, and you want a tangent line at a point—

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and that’s what differential calculus tries to do.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It tries to find the slope of that line at a point.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now integral calculus, on the other hand, solves the problem

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of finding the area under the curve for a function.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you look at a sine function, then it tries to find

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the area under this curve between the two limits over here.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now what the fundamental theorem of calculus does is

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
it ties these two ideas together.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In this lesson, what we’ll do is to go over

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
this very important theorem.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In fact, by far, this is the most basic fact of calculus

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that you really should know in order to apply it in practice.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay. Let’s begin with the idea of an integral function.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here I’m defining a function of <i>x</i>

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
which is given by the integral of <i>t</i> from 0 to <i>x</i>.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Basically what it does it is takes the function <i>g</i>[<i>t</i>] = <i>t</i>

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and integrates from 0 to <i>x</i>.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Obviously if <i>x</i> is 0, then the value is 0

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
because you’re integrating from 0 to 0, so you get back 0.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In general, it calculates the area under the curve from 0 to <i>x</i>.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That’s the integral function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and here is a graph of the function and <i>x</i>.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What we notice is that as <i>x</i> increases,

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the value of this function also increases

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
because the upper limit over here increases.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The integral function is increasing because the area increases,

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
in this case, as x increases.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now the point is that there is actually an explicit formula

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
for this integral function.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What we do is we begin with the integral from 0 to <i>x</i>

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and break it up into <i>n</i> parts, and then we set up the Riemann sum.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In this case, the Riemann sum is going to be <i>g</i>(<i>xi</i>)—

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
those are sample points—times the width of each subinterval.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then you sum them all up and take a limit,

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and what you get back is <i>x</i>^2/2.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But then you remind yourself that the antiderivative of <i>g</I>[<i>t</i>]

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
is also <i>t</i>^2/2 plus some constant.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Here’s a check for that.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It looks like the integral function for <i>g</i>[<i>t</i>]

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
is actually an antiderivative of <i>g</i>[<i>t</i>].

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now that looks very surprising,

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
so what we’ll do is we’ll try and go a bit deeper

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and develop some intuition for why that might be the case.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let’s begin over here with the integral function again

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and think of the difference at two points, <i>f</i>[<i>x</i> + <i>h</i>] and <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]—

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
two close-by points with <i>h</i> being very small.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now that difference over here would just be

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the area of a tiny strip because <i>h</i> is very small.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Here’s a picture.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The area of that strip is simply the width times the height,

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
which is just the <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>], so the area is <i>h</i> * <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But then that is <i>f</i>[<i>x</i> + <i>h</i>] – <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], so if you divide,

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
then you get back this relation over here.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
As <i>h</i> goes to 0, that says that <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>] = <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
In other words, <I>f</I>[<i>x</i>] is an antiderivative of <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It is this remarkable fact which is summarized

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
in the fundamental theorem of calculus.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There are two versions.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That’s version 1 over here.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It says that if you have a continuous function <i>g</i>

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and you define <i>f</i> to be an integral from 0 to <i>x</i>—

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
from <i>a</i> to <I>x</i>, in this case—then what you get back

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
is a function, an integral function, and this integral function

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
is actually an antiderivative of <i>g</i>.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In other words, <i>f</I>'[<i>x</i>] is equal to <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let’s try and understand that a bit more

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
by looking at some examples.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let’s say you have the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] given by the integral

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
from 0 to <i>x</i> for Sin(√1 + <I>t</i>^2)<i>dt</i> and you integrate it.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Then you just get back Sin(√1 + <i>x</i>^2).

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Here’s a check; namely, if we take

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the derivative of the integral function,

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you will get back just the original function.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That’s the summary over here which says that

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
if you take a function, integrate it and then differentiate it,

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
you get back the original function.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now the problem is the upper limit itself

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
might depend on <I>x</i> in some complicated way.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In that case, you must apply the chain rule.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let’s say <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>] is the integral 0 to <i>x</i>^2

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
of the same function.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then if you differentiate that with respect to <i>x</i>,

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you will need to account for the <i>x</i>^2,

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
so you get back a factor of 2<i>x</i> over here.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let’s check that.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You get back 2<i>x</i>Sin(√1 + <i>x</i>^4).

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay. Let’s now go on to talking about why these integral functions

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
are useful at all.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There is a function called the Fresnel function

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
which really quite useful in optics and highway design.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
After all, if you design a highway or you design, let’s say,

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
a very long line, you need to worry about the turns,

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and that’s where this Fresnel function comes in.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It’s the integral function of a sine function.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We have this in the Wolfram Language.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It’s called FresnelS.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That’s FresnelS and its derivative on the same plot.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The blue plot is the Fresnel function and the orange plot is

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
its derivative, which is just the sine function over here.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Another very useful function is the error function,

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
which is also an integral function,

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and that’s used in statistics and probability.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Here is the error function with its derivative.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You have the error function, which is blue,

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
over here, and the derivative.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It’s just a normal probability curve.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What happens is as you approach very large values,

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the probability of everything being covered is almost 1,

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
so that’s why the values over here are almost 1.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay. Now there is another more useful version

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
of the fundamental theorem, and that’s version 2,

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
which says that suppose you have a function <i>f</i>

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and you find an antiderivative of that function by some means.

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then the value of the integral from <i>a</I> to <i>b</i> of this function <i>f</i>

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
is the antidervative at <i>b</i> minus the antiderivative at <i>a</i>.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In other words, the integral of an antiderivative

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
can be found quite easily by simply working out

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the difference between the values at the upper and the lower limits.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That says that differentiation and integration

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
are actually the inverse processes of each other.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That’s quite a remarkable fact.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
For example, if you’re asked to find

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the integral of <i>x</i>^2 from 1 to 4,

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
then you first work out the antiderivative, which is <i>x</i>^3/3.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then you plug in the upper and lower limits,

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
so you get 4^3/3 – 1^3/3, and the answer 21.

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can check that with Integrate and get back just the same result.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson,

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
but the main point is that the fundamental theorem of calculus

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
is one of the most important theorems in calculus

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
because it says that differentiation and integration

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
are the inverse processes of each other.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
In fact, its real utility is to compute integrals

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
by using antiderivatives

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Basically, using the antiderivatives is much easier

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
than using Riemann sums.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Instead of calculating Riemann sums,

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you would calculate antiderivatives.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The next lesson will talk about indefinite integrals.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But before that, do review this lesson over here

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
because we have covered one of the most important theorems in calculus,

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and that’s going to be used all the time.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let’s stop over here.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you very much,

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and I hope you have learned a lot in this lesson.
