00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 26 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is indefinite integrals.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the last lesson we talked about

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the fundamental theorem of calculus,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which connects differential calculus and integral calculus.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
For example, if I said find the integral of this function, 4<i>x</i>^3,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
from 2 to 3, then the answer is simply 3^4  – 2^4—

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that’s 65—

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and that’s because an antiderivative of 4<i>x</i>^3 is <i>x</i>^4.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let’s just check that with D.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If we try the same thing with Integrate

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but now we tell it to find the integral of the function from 2 to 3,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
you get back just the same answer.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What we’ve learned is that the antiderivative is, in fact,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a very nice way to do integration.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hence, we give it a special name.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We call it the indefinite integral.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The goal of this lesson is to review the indefinite integrals

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
or antiderivatives that you’ve learned so far.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Before going on, just a few notes.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
First of all, to repeat myself,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
the antiderivative will now be referred to as the indefinite integral,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and sometimes people just say integral.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you take Integrate and you find Integrate[<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], <i>x</i>],

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
then the answer is <i>x</i>^4 for our example

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
because it’s really computing an indefinite integral

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
when you do not give it any range.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Notice one thing: that the answer from Integrate does not include

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the constant of integration

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
which you would learn in a course on calculus,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
so you must put this in yourself.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So please be careful when you work with indefinite integration.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You will need to put that constant in by hand.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now if you want to compute a definite integral,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
then you must actually put in the lower limit and the upper limit,

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and then you get back the same answer you did earlier on,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which is 65.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Here is a plot showing the function and its integral.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Once again, please note that we’ll set the constant

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
for the integral to be 0, essentially.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let’s begin now with some examples.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you take a constant function, then the integral of this function

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
is just <i>kx</i> where <i>k</i> is the constant.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Again, mentally you must just put in the constant of integration,

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so you get <i>kx</i> + <i>C</i>.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
For example, if the function is 3, then the integral is 3<i>x</i>.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Here is a picture of the function and its integral.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Notice that I am putting the evaluate over here inside the plot,

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and that’s because I’d like Integrate to do its work

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
before Plot does the plotting.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay. On to a linear function.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Suppose you have <i>kx</i> + <i>b</i>.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then its integral is <i>kx</i>^2/2 + <i>bx</i> + <i>C</i>.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That plus <i>C</i>, again, is coming from the constant in integration.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
For example, if you have 5<i>x</i> + 4,  then the answer is (5<i>x</i>^2/2) + 4<i>x</i>.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Here’s a plot of both the function and its integral.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay. On to power functions.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you have <i>x</i>^<i>a</i>, then its integral is <i>x</i>^(<i>a</i> + 1)/(<i>a</i> + 1).

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That’s the answer with the constant of integration.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
For example, if I give you <i>x</i>^3, then the answer is <i>x</i>^4/4,

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
which you see in the plot over here.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay. On to trigonometric functions now.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you look at the sine function and the cosine function,

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
then the integral of sine is negative cosine

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
because the derivative of negative cosine is sine.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The integral of cosine is sine.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So we have two important indefinite integrals

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
for sine and for cosine.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Here’s a plot of the functions and integrals.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay. On to slightly harder examples.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If I give you secant times tangent

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or negative cosecant times cotangent,

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
then in the first case, the integral is Sec[<i>x</i>]

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
because the derivative of Sec[<i>x</I>] is Sec[<i>x</i>]Tan[<i>x</i>],

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and similarly for the second example.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We’ve now found two more trig integrals.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Here’s a plot of all the functions involved over here.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
As my final example, let’s take even harder trig functions.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If I give you Sec[<i>x</i>]^2 and –Csc[<i>x</i>]^2,

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
then the first integral is Tan[<i>x</i>]

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
because the derivative of Tan[<i>x</i>] is Sec[<i>x</i>]^2,

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and similarly, the derivative of Cot[<i>x</i>] is –Csc[<i>x</i>]^2.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Again, here’s a plot of all the functions and their integrals.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay. That’s all that there is for today’s lesson.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It’s a short lesson where we’ve talked about

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the antiderivative of a function and given it a special name,

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
namely, the indefinite integral.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What we have learned is that you can find

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the indefinite integrals of many functions—the constant function,

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the linear function, the power function

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and several trigonometric functions.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Now in most cases you can simply call the Integrate function

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and it will find the indefinite integral for you,

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
but make sure you put the constant of integration.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That’s really the core of indefinite integration.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about the substitution rule,

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
which actually makes things easier when you have

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
more difficult examples

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and perhaps more interesting examples to talk about.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I’ll stop over here.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do review this very important lesson.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It’s not very difficult, but it’s important

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and basically everything that follows,

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and then the next time, we’ll talk about the substitution rule.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
