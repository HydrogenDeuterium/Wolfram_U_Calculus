00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 28 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is areas between curves.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the topic.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you calculate an integral, you’re really finding the area

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
between the curve of a function and the <i>x</i> axis.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For example, here’s a function,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and when you compute the integral for that function,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
then what you’re really doing is to find the area under the curve.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In this case, it’s the area between –1 and 1,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which are the limits for the integral over here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The question is what would happen

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
if you want to find the area between two curves?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This lesson will go over

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
several examples of how we can do this using Integrate.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay. Let’s take an example.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let’s say <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = 5 and <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>] = –<i>x</i>^2 + 1.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now clearly in this case, the function <i>f</i>

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is greater than the function <i>g</i> because that’s positive

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and that’s going to be negative for most of the time,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but it won’t go over 1.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now when you want to work out the area between them,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
what you do is look at the Riemann sums.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now in this case, the Riemann sums will have

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
a height equal to <i>f</i> minus <i>g</i> for each strip,

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and the width will be (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)/<i>n</i> where <i>b</i> and <i>a</i>

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
are the limits of the integration interval.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now the Riemann sum will be the sum of the heights times the widths,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which is the same as the integral of <i>f</i> minus <i>g</i>.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Basically, if you want to find the area between the preceding curves,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
then all you go is you work out the integral of <i>f</i> minus <i>g</i>,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and you get back the answer—76/3 in this case.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay. Now two questions.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
First question: what would happen if

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
you didn’t know the limits of integration?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Secondly, what would happen if you had to actually work out

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
which function, greater or less.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But before that, let’s take a simple example.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here are two functions, and you want to work out

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the area between them with <i>x</i> = 1 on the left and <i>x</i> = 5 on the right.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In this case, everything is given to you, so we can work out

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the integral of <i>f</i> minus <i>g</i> and get the answer 88.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here is a plot of the area which we just computed.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now back to the question which I asked earlier on.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
First question: what happens if you’re not given any endpoints?

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let’s say you’ve got two functions, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>,

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and you want to find the area enclosed between the curves

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
given by these functions.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What you do then is you work out

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the points of intersection using Solve.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The curves intersect at –√3 and √3.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here is a plot of the curves between those limits,

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and you can see clearly that <i>f</i> is above <i>g</i> in all cases,

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
so we can work out the integral of <i>f</i> minus <i>g</i>,

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and you get the answer with the area enclosed between these curves.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
On the other hand, suppose you have the functions Sin[<i>x</i>] and Cos[<i>x</I>].

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can see that the functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are either

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
above or below each other depending upon where you are.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let’s say you want to find the area between –3π/4 and 5π/4.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That’s roughly starting over here and ending over there.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Initially, the cosine function is greater than the sine function,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and then the sine function is greater than the cosine

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
for the rest of the interval.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
On the first interval, –3π/4 to 5π/4, you have <i>g</i> minus <i>f</i>

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
because <i>g</i> is greater than <i>f</i>, and then you do the opposite

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
for the rest of the interval.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then you add the two answers, and you get back 4√2.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The point is you will now need to divide the integration

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
into two parts depending upon the behavior of <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Instead of doing that, what we do is we just call Integrate

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
with the absolute value function,

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
which will take care of all the difficulties, and you get back

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
just the same answer from Integrate.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Given two functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>,

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
if you do not know which one is greater or less,

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
then you use the absolute value function to find the area.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay. Let’s now talk about cases where you’ve got a function of <i>y</I>.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So <i>x</i> is given as a function of <i>y</i> in these two functions, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
To find the area in this case, you now need <i>y</i> limits.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Again, you work with Riemann sums, but now you have

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Riemann sums with widths given by Δ<i>y</i>.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Instead of talking about upper and below,

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
we talk about rightmost and leftmost functions.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In this case, if you plot the functions,

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
it is clear that the function <i>g</I> is to the right of the function <i>f</i>,

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
so the area will be given by

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the integral of <i>g</i> minus <i>f</i> between –5 and 5.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay. Now an example where you might actually need this is

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
let’s say you’re given <i>y</i> = 3<i>x</i> + 1 and the parabola <i>y</i>^2 = <i>x</i> + 4.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In this case, <i>y</i> is not a function of <i>x</i>, so we try and write <i>x</i>

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
as a function of <i>y</i> by solving.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Set up two functions from the first solution over here

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and the second solution over there.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then you find out where they intersect.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do a parametric plot, and it’s clear that

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
you actually have the function <i>f</i> to the right of <i>g</i>.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You do Integrate of <i>f</I> minus <i>g</i> between the limits (1 – √133)/6,

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
et cetera, and you get back the answer

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
for the area between those two curves.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can either work with <i>x</I> limits or <i>y</i> limits.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They both work just fine.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It’s now time to summarize the lesson.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Basically, finding the area between curves

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
is really easy once you have integrals.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In case the function <i>f</i> is greater than the function <i>g</i>,

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you simply do the integral of <i>f</i> minus <I>g</i>.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now when you don’t have that information,

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
then what you do is you figure out

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
where the functions intersect using Solve,

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
figure out which function is above and which one is below,

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and then you find the integral by doing

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the integral of <i>f</I> minus <i>g</i> or <i>g</i> minus <i>f</i>,

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
or simply using the absolute value function.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Of course if you’re given functions of
 <i>y</i>,

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
then you work with <i>y</i> integrals,

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
so let’s say you might do the integral of <i>f</I> minus <i>g</i>

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in a case where you know that <i>f</I> is to the right of <i>g</i>.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about volume of solids.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But before that, do review this topic of area between curves.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It’s a very important and useful part of calculus.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
