00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 29 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is volumes of solids.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of today’s lesson.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thus far we’ve been talking about the area under curves,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we’ve used integral calculus for doing that.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, if you work out this integral over here,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
then what you’re really doing is

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to work out the area under the curve <i>y</i> = <i>x</i>^2 between 2 and 3.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The point is that you can also use integral calculus

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to find the volume of solids, and that would be

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a big advancement if we could learn it.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let’s look at a very simple example of a solid like over here.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What we can do is we can actually calculate

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the volume of this solid or others using calculus.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This lesson is about one method for computing such volumes.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The solid that we spoke of just now was a cylinder of course,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and if you think of a cylinder, it can be constructed

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
by taking a plane region, and then you sweep out a volume.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For example, let’s say you take this disk over here

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and you sweep out a volume up to a certain height

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and you get a cylinder.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That’s a hint for finding the volume of a cylinder;

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
namely, you think of it as being composed of disks.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you want to find the volume of a cylinder, what you do is

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you take the base area

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and then multiply it by the height to get the volume.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
For example, here’s a disk.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can work out its area,

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and that’s a cylinder with that disk as a base and height 4,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and its volume is 4π.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Basically the volume of the cylinder is

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the area of the base times the height, which is 4 in this case.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now of course there are many more

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
shapes and solids in the Wolfram Language

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and you can work out their volumes directly,

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but what you might want to do is to work out

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the volumes of even more general solids.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here’s an example.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You have a three-dimensional region.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you look at this region, you think of it

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
as being composed of square cross sections.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you were to slice the region, you would see that

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the area of each piece is 4<i>x</i>^2 because you have

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
squares with lengths and widths of 2<i>x</i>.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The volume of each piece would be 4<i>x</i>^2Δ<i>x</i>,

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and then you can add them all up, so to speak,

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and get the total volume to be the integral of 4<i>x</i>^2<i>dx</i>

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
between the right limits.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
For example, if you want to define the limits as 1 and 3,

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
then the volume is 104/3.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay. Now let’s try and generalize that a bit more.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you have a solid with cross-section area <i>A</i>[<i>x</i>],

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
then its volume is the integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> of <i>A</i>(<i>x</i>)<I>dx</i>

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the limits within which you want to find the volume.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For example, if you want to find the volume of a ball

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
like over here and the radius is <i>r</i>,

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
then each cross section has got a radius of √(<i>r</i>^2 – <i>x</i>^2).

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So the cross sections of the left end have got very small areas.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
As you go to the middle, the area increases.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Basically, the area will be π(<i>r</i>^2 – <i>x</i>^2).

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You add them all up and you get the volume of the ball,

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
which is of course (4π<i>r</i>^3)/3.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can check that with Volume and get back just the same result.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay. Let’s use the same idea to talk about

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
what are called solves of revolutions.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Here’s a function, and what you can do is

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
you can take the graph of this function

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and revolve it around the <i>x</i> axis, and then you get a solid.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Here’s how we do it.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You use RevolutionPlot3D, and you get this solid

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
obtained by revolving the curve about the <i>x</i> axis.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Of course you could also revolve it around the <i>y</i> axis

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and get a slightly different solid.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The question is how do you work out the volume in these cases?

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay. What you do is you can again divide the volume into disks,

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but in this case, each cross section is a disk whose radius is <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
the value of the function <i>f</i> at <i>x</i>, so the volume will be

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> of π<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]^2<i>dx</i>.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let’s say you want to find the volume from –1 to 1.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We get back the integral over here, which is 2π/5.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Just to remind you, that was the original parabola,

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and that was the solid obtained by revolving around the <i>x</i> axis.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now you might, let’s say, want to revolve it around the line <i>y</i> = 1,

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
in which case you just subtract off 1

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
because if you look at the volume over here,

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you see that you actually have different radii

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
depending upon where you are.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Basically you shift down the function by one

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to get the correct picture.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Then the radius of each cross section is 1 – <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
so you can work out the volume as the integral of π(1 – <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>])^2

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
between the correct limits.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Similarly, if you want to find, let’s say,

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
the volume obtained by revolving around the line <i>y</i> = –1,

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
then you add a 1.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Here’s the picture.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Again, work out the volume with an integral

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and you get back the answer.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Basically, shift the function up by 1 in this case.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now a second method for computing volumes

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is the so-called washer method.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The idea is simple.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You have two functions, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>,

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and you look at the area between them

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and then you revolve it around the <i>x</i> axis.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Here’s a nice demonstration of that.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You revolve it. It sweeps out the volume.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The question is how do you work out a formula for that volume?

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What you do is you remind yourself that now each cross section

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is like a washer because it’s got a kind of outer and inner radius.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That’s the area of this washer.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We work out the integral for the volume,

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and that’s the method for finding the volume using the washer method.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But of course we might have liked to go around the <i>y</i> axis,

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
in which case we do just the opposite.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You write <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> as functions of <i>y</i>

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and then do a similar integral to get back the answer.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That brings me to the end of the lesson.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The main point is that you can use integrals

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to find the volumes of solids,

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and that’s quite a powerful idea.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let’s say if you have a cylinder, then its volume is base times height,

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
where <i>B</i> is the area of the base.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you have a more general solid with the cross-sectional area <i>A</i>[<i>x</i>],

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
then you’ll compute an integral to find the volume.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you have a solid of revolution

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
obtained by revolving the function around a certain line,

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
then you can compute its volume using the formula over here.

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Typically you might just want <i>y</i> to be 0,

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
so you’re revolving around the <i>x</i> axis.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you have two functions

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and you want to revolve the area between them,

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
then you apply the washer method and apply the formula over here.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Of course you can repeat the same thing

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
for revolving around the line <i>x</i> = <i>x</i>0.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That’s the end of this lesson about the volume of solids

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
using the so-called disk method and the washer method.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about another method

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
which is called the cylindrical shell method.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That’s a little easier in some cases, but that’s for next time.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Do review today’s lesson.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It’s quite a difficult lesson.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I’ll see you next time.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
