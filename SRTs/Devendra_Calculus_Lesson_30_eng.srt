00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 30 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is volumes by cylindrical shells.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In the previous lesson, we learned about the disk and washer methods

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
for finding the volumes of solids.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As an example of the disk method,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
let’s say you have the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and you rotate that around the <i>x</i> axis from 1 to 4.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You get a solid of this type.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
To find the volume, what you do is you break up the solid into disks,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and each disk then has a radius of <i>x</i>^2, the value of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
so the area of this disk is π<i>r</i>^2 times, of course, the height,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
which is the infinitesimal volume.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then you get the integral of that giving you the volume of the solid.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The washer method is very simple and similar

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
because all you do is instead of working with one disk,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
you simply subtract the volume of two disks, the outer and inner.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Basically it works on washers or rings or annuli

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or whatever you call them.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now a slightly harder example.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Suppose you have the function shown over here

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and you want to revolve it around the <i>y</i> axis, not the <i>x</i> axis.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then it’s not clear what one means by the inner and outer radii.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The goal of this lesson is to talk about

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the so-called cylindrical shell method

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which makes this example and similar examples very simple.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let’s build some intuition for the method.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let’s say you want to find the volume of the solid.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You break it into pieces, but these pieces

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
are now going to be shells rather than cross sections.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because each cell looks like a cylinder,

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
it’s called the cylindrical shell method.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Here’s a typical cylinder.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It’s very thin.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It has an outer radius of <i>r</i>2 and an inner radius of <i>r</i>1,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
so that is the difference in the volumes of outer and inner,

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which will give you the volume of that thin shell.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you factor it a little bit, you could rewrite it as

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
2π<i>h</i> times the average of <i>r</i>1 and <i>r</i>2

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
times the difference between <i>r</i>1 and <i>r</i>2 like over here.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now because it’s very thin, you can let <i>r</i>2 approach <I>r</i>1,

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
in which case the difference over here becomes <i>dr</i>

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and the average becomes just <i>r</i>1.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now because you only have one <i>r</i> left, you might as well call it <i>r</i>.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The volume now becomes 2π<i>hrdr</i>.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The question is what’s <i>h</i>?

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, <I>h</i> is the value of the function <i>f</i> as a function of <i>r</i>.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The height <i>h</i> becomes now <i>f</i>[<i>r</i>],

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
so you have a very nice, simple formula for the volume

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
by the method of cylindrical shells.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
To go back to our example from the introduction,

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you have this function, <i>f</i>[<I>x</i>] = 4<i>x</i>^3 – <I>x</i>^4.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You want to work out the volume, so you simply do 2π<I>r</i>

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
times the value of the function over here times <i>dr</i>.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You work it out with Integrate, and you get back the result.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay. Now the question is which method should you use,

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the washer or disk method or the cylindrical shell method?

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let’s say here’s an example in which you have two curves,

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>x</i>^2 and <i>x</i>^3, but you want to revolve it around the <i>y</i> axis.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With the washer method, you could rewrite things

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
as cube roots and square roots and get the answer,

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but in this case, it’s much simpler

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
to simply work with the cylindrical shell method,

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and you get back the same result.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You do get the same answer, but the question is which one to use.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That’s up to you, but typically, the cylindrical shell method

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
works well when the axis of the cylinder

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
is the same as the rotation axis.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay. Some minor variations.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let’s say you have a function like over here,

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and you want to rotate it around the line <i>x</i> = 6

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
rather than the <i>y</i> axis, let’s say.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Then what you do first of all is you find the radius.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Keep in mind that the radius is now going to be <i>6</i> – x

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
because you are counting from <i>x</i> = 6, so that’s the radius.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have 2π times radius times function value,

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and you get back the answer with the cylindrical shell method.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
On the other hand, if you have a negative axis,

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
so let’s say you have <i>x</i> = –1 over here, and you have this function.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Now if you if you look at the radius, it’s going to be <i>x</i> + 1.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your formula is slightly different.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You have 2π(<i>x</i> + 1)<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You work out the answer, and you get back the volume in this case.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We spoke a little earlier about comparing the two methods,

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
washer/disk and cylinder.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let’s take an example

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
where the disk or washer method works a little better.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let’s say you have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = CubeRoot[<i>x</i>].

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You now revolve around the <i>x</i> axis from 0 to 1.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If you try the cylindrical shell method, things become a bit harder

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
because now the shell height is horizontal rather than vertical.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you had to apply the cylindrical shell method,

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
you would first of all rewrite the function as a function of <i>y</i>,

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
then work out the shell radius, then work out the integral.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But with the disk method, things are much simpler

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
because you simply have the cube root of <i>x</i> as the function,

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
so you apply π times <i>r</i>^2<i>dx</i>, integrate from 0 to 1

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and you get back the same volume.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In general, both these methods—

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the cylindrical shell method and the washer/disk method—

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
have advantages and disadvantages,

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and you must decide which one is better suited for your problem.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of the lesson.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Basically, what we’ve learned is that the cylindrical shell method

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
is another nice way of finding the volume of solids.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This method works by breaking up the solid into cylindrical shells.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Those shells are very, very thin, and the height of the shell

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is the value of the function.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sometimes you’ll find that the cylindrical shell method

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
is much easier, and it can be very cumbersome or even impossible

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to apply the disk/washer method.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But other times, you might find that the disk/washer method

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is a lot easier to understand and use, so you might prefer that.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just to review the formulae for the lesson,

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
first of all if you revolve around the line <i>x</i> = <i>x</i>0

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
where <i>x</i>0 is positive, then you get <i>x</i>0 – <i>x</i> as the radius,

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
so think back to the example involving 6 – <i>x</i>.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
On the other hand, if you have a negative or 0 value for <i>x</i>0,

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
then you’ll have <i>x</i> – <i>x</i>0 over here, so think back to the example

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
which had an <i>x</i> + 1, which really was an <i>x</i> minus –1.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Those two very simple formulae tell you what you need to do

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
for the cylindrical shell method,

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and that makes it a very simple method wherever it works.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the average value of a function with integration,

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but before doing that, do review today’s lesson.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It’s a very important lesson.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It tells you how to find the volumes of very difficult-looking solids,

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and it really shows you how powerful calculus is.

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
