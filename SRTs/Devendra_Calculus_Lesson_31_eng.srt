00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 31 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is average value of a function.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let’s say you have a list of numbers like over here,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and you want to work out their average value.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Of course what you do is just add the numbers

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then divide by the number of numbers,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which is 10 in this case, and you get back the answer.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You also have a function called Mean in the Wolfram Language

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which does just the same thing for you,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and you get back the same answer.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now let’s say instead of a list of values,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you had a function like the one shown over here.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here’s a plot of the function.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The question is can we work out

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the average value of such a function?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The answer is yes.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Here’s some intuition.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let’s say your function runs from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You break the interval into <i>n</i> subintervals,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
take a sample point for each subinterval

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and then work out the average value like over here.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now we want to rewrite it as a Riemann sum,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so the <i>n</i> over here can be thought of as being related to Δ<i>x</i>,

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the length of each subinterval.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So  Δ<i>x</i> is (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)/<i>n</i>, and hence <i>n</I> is (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)/Δ<i>x</i>.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You can rewrite the average in a slightly different form

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
in which it’s clear that if you now let <i>n</I> go to ∞

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
so you’ve got very small subintervals,

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
then what you get back is the integral

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
divided by the length of the interval.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That’s the average value of a function.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It’s the integral of the function over an interval

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
divided by the length of the interval.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let’s say in our example, if you want to work out the average value,

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you simply find the integral from 0 to 5 and then divide by 5,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and you get back the answer.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay. Now a much deeper fact is

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
something called the mean value theorem, which says that

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
if you have a continuous function on an interval,

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
then there is at least one number <i>c</i> in that interval

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
such that the value of the function is equal to the average value.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That should remind you of the mean value theorem for derivatives,

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
which was the same thing,

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but now for integrals over intervals and areas rather than slopes.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you multiply both sides by <i>b</i> – <i>a</i>,

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
what you get on the left-hand side is just the area of a rectangle

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
with height <i>f</i>(<i>c</i>) and length <i>b</i> – <i>a</i>,

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and the right-hand side is the integral.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here is a visual interpretation of the whole thing.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let’s say that this is your curve,

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and now you have the area under the curve, and that’s the rectangle.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now there’s a bit of area that’s common over here,

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and then a bit over here which only belongs to the rectangle

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and a bit that only belongs to the curve,

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and what we’re saying over here is that the area of this rectangle

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is equal to the area under the curve.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That’s quite a remarkable theorem.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It’s very deep and shows you how powerful calculus is.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We’re able to reduce the area under a curve

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to the area of a rectangle,

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
which is the simplest thing one might think about in areas.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay. As an application, here’s a function,

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and you want to find a value in the interval –2 to 3

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
such that the function value is equal to

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the average value over that interval.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now because the function is continuous, it’s a polynomial,

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
so you can certainly apply the theorem, the mean value theorem.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let’s say you want to do that.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You solve the equation <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>] equal to the average value,

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and when you do that, you get back an answer.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Here’s a plot which shows the point at which

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
the average value is actually retained.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That’s the mean value theorem in action.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But the main point is that sometimes you can get

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
more than one point at which the average value is retained.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Here’s an example.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You have a function.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You try and work out the average value, and then work out

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the point at which you want to check whether

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the average value equals the function value.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You get two points now, and here’s a picture which says

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that you really have two points at which

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the average value is attained.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
As an application of these ideas,

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
here’s a temperature for a city <i>t</i> hours after noon.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You plot the temperate from 1pm to 3am,

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and the question is, is there a time at which the temperature

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
equals the average temperature?

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The answer is yes.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just solve the equation and you get back that <i>c</i> is about 8.57.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That’s in hours, so that means at around 8:34pm,

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the temperature will be equal to the average temperature

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
over the time period.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
As another application, let’s look at a car on a highway.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Here is the velocity of the car, and you want to find

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the average velocity over the time period.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What you do is you simply integrate

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and divide by the time interval.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Here’s a plot which shows clearly that

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the average value is attained at two different points,

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
so the average velocity is attained twice in the interval.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson,

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
but the main point for today is that with integration,

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
you can find the average value of a function over an interval.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That average value is given by the integral

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
divided by the length of the interval.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The mean value theorem is a very powerful theorem

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
which says that if you have a continuous function,

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
then it takes on its average value at least once—

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
could be more than once, but at least once—in the interval.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Of course once you have this very powerful theorem,

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you could apply it to temperatures or velocities

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
or all kinds of other fillable phenomena.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You have the mean value theorem, which tells you that

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the area under the curve is equal to the area of a certain rectangle.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That’s a very powerful theorem for calculus.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In the next lesson we’ll talk about approximate values of integrals,

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
but for now, do review this lesson,

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
go over the idea for the mean value

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and I’ll see you next time.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
