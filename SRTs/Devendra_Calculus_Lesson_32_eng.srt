00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 32 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is approximate integration.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So far, you’ve been using integration to calculate

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the area under curves, et cetera, and the point is

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
if you can compute an integral, then you can work out the area.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For example, if you can work out the integral of <i>x</i>^2,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which is of course <i>x</i>^3/3, then you can work out

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the area under the curve for <i>y</I> = <i>x</i>^2 between,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
let’s say, 2 and 5 in two ways:

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
either you can actually plug in the upper and lower limits 5 and 2

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
in the answer on the earlier step or you can use Integrate,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and you get back just the same result.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The point is that some functions have no known closed form

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
for their integrals.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here’s an example: <i>e</i>^<i>e</i>^<I>x</i>^2 does not have an integral.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The question is what do we do in such a case?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How do you find the area under the curve in such cases?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In this lesson, we’ll go over some ways

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to evaluate such integrals numerically or approximately.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As a first step, let’s look at so-called left and right approximations.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
When we began integration, we talked about the area of a region

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
as being a kind of Riemann sum, so you have the function value

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
at some sample points times the length of each subinterval,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then the sample points could be chosen in various ways.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In the first case over here, if I choose <i>i</i> – 1 over here,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
then basically I get the left-end sample points,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
so the rectangles have their upper left-hand corners

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
lying on the curve.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you have an <i>i</i> over here,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
then you get upper-right corners lying on the curve.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Here’s a plot to show all that.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In this first case, you have the left approximations,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and in the second case, you have the right approximations.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It’s clear in the first case you’re kind of under approximating,

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and in the second case you’re over approximating.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let’s now actually work out the answers using the sum over here,

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and you get back the answers 1.285 and 1.385.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That’s the left sum.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That’s the right sum.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The actual answer is sandwiched between those two numbers.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It’s 1.3333, which is somewhere between

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the left and the right answers.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The question is can we do any better?

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, what we could do is to take

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the midpoints of each subinterval as the sample point.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Here’s the midpoint in each case.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then the rectangles have the middle of their tops

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
going through the curve.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Here’s a plot with our function,

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and you can see over here that things are better

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
because you have some extra area over here, for example,

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and some less area over there, so it looks like this might give you

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
a better approximation than the earlier method.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let’s do that, and you do find that you get a better approximation.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Another method might be to use the so-called trapezoidal rule.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Earlier we spoke about the left and right approximations,

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and that’s the actual integral.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you work them out, you can get back 1.285, 1.385, 1.3333.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But what you could do is to take an average of the right and left

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and compare it with the actual integral,

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and that definitely looks much better.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Effectively what you’re doing is you’re taking a trapezoid

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
in each case with the height of the trapezoid equal to Δ<i>x</i>

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and the two lengths over here being

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
the lengths of the function heights at those points.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Here’s the answer for that trapezoidal rule,

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and you get back just the same result.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Now to go a step further, one could actually try and use polynomials,

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and that’s what is called Simpson’s rule.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
With Simpson’s rule, what we’ll do is use parabolas

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to approximate the area under the curve.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But that’s a much harder problem,

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so you get back a slightly more complicated formula.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You do need to take an even number of points,

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and then basically you take <i>x</i>0, <i>x</i>1, <i>x</i>2 et cetera in triples

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to compute the sum for the area.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That’s a particular combination.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You have 1, 4, 1 as the combination on your subinterval.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Here’s the computation with our earlier example

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and, let’s say, 10 subregions.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What you get back is the exact answer.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Simpson’s rule is extremely powerful.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It tries to use parabolae to compute the approximation,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and in this simple case, it actually gets to the exact answer.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now whenever we do any kind of approximation,

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you need to worry about errors.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
For the midpoint rule, it turns out that if you have

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
an upper-bound <i>K</i> for the second derivative,

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
then that’s the error for the length of <I>b</i> – <i>a</i> for the interval

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and <i>n</i> rectangles.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The trapezoidal rule has a very similar formula,

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
but in fact the error is exactly twice the midpoint rule error.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Simpson’s rule is a lot better

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because now you look at the fourth derivative,

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and you get back an error term over here.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Those are the maximum errors

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
for each method that we have spoken about.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The midpoint case and the trapezoidal case,

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
you can work out the errors—they’re quite small—

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and compare them with the actual errors,

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
namely, the difference between the actual integrals

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and the midpoint method and the trapezoidal method,

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and you get back just the same result.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The question now is

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
why did Simpson’s rule give you no error?

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The point is that you have a quadratic polynomial,

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
so its fourth derivative is 0,

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and so there is no error in the Simpson’s method.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay. Fortunately in the Wolfram Language,

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
we have a wonderful function called NIntegrate

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
which actually computes numerical integrals very nicely.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
For the example in our introduction, <i>e</i>^<i>e</i>^<i>x</i>^2,

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you get back a nice answer quite quickly.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Here is a plot of that area.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In general, NIntegrate uses very highly optimized methods.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It does not use any particular method, but it might use

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
some very general, efficient algorithm to compute the answer.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You do get back the best possible answer,

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and I strongly recommend you check your answers with NIntegrate.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But of course you might say oh, I really want to have

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
my own function done my way to compute integrals.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, you can do that.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You can make your own functions.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We’ll learn that in a later lesson.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For numerical integration, you can either make up your own functions

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
or simply call NIntegrate.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They are both fine, but you must decide

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
how accurate you want your answer to be.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay. Finally, one might sometimes only have a table of values.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Here’s an example.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You’re given a table of values for the speed of a particle

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
at 11 instances of time.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Those are the times and the speeds,

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and you’ve got the trapezoidal rule.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Basically what happens over here is you have the left endpoint

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and the right endpoint of the intervals,

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and then you have everything else getting counted twice.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
For Simpson’s rule, you have the left endpoint, the right endpoint

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and then everything else getting counted four times.

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That’s the Simpson’s rule answer.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They are pretty close.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Here’s a plot of the data.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Basically you can compute a numerical approximation

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
given only a table of values.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
After all, all of today’s formulas depend only upon

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
knowing the values at a certain fixed number of points.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson,

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and the main point is that if you can’t find

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the integral of a function,

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
then you certainly can approximate it by various methods.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There are various techniques available.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You could use left or right approximations.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You could use the midpoint rule,

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the trapezoidal rule or Simpson’s rule.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You could also use NIntegrate, which is a very powerful function

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and will give you the best possible approximation

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
that it came up with while finding the integral.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Finally, you can use a table of values

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to compute a numerical approximation.

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That’s good enough.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
In the next lesson, we’ll go over exponential functions.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But before doing that, do review today’s topic.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It’s a very interesting, useful part of calculus

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
because very often in practice, you cannot find an exact answer.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In that case, a numerical method is the best that you have.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
