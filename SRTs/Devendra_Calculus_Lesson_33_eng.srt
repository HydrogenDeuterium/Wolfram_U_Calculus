00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 33 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is exponential functions.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In the past, we have talked about polynomials

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and other kinds of functions.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, over here the function <i>f</i> is a polynomial function,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the function <i>g</i> is a rational function,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the function <I>h</i> is an algebraic function

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the function <i>p</i> is a trigonometric function.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here are the plots of these functions.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In this lesson, we’ll go a step forward

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and talk about so-called exponential functions.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let’s begin with a definition.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
An exponential function is a function with the form <i>a</i>^<i>x</i>

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
where <i>a</i> is a non-negative value.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Of course what that means depends upon what that <i>x</i> is.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If <i>x</i> is a positive integer, then all you do is

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you multiply the number <i>a</i> by itself <i>x</i> times.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here’s 3^4, and that’s just 81.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But if <i>x</i> is a negative integer, then you take a reciprocal.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In this case, you have 3^–4, giving you 1/81.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Finally if <i>x</i> is 0, then <I>a</i>^0 is just 1.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Of course, we can go beyond that.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If <i>x</i> is a fraction like <i>p</i>/<i>q</i>, then you can either take

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
a <i>p</i>th power and then a <i>q</i>th root or the other way around,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and in the Wolfram Language, we have the Surd function

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
which does that nicely for you.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The main point is that these exponential functions grow very fast.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In fact, they grow faster than any polynomial function.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Here are some plots of these functions.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If <i>a</i> is greater than 1 like 3^<i>x</i>,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
then you have a very rapidly growing function.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But if <i>a</i> is between 0 and 1,

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
then the function is a decreasing function.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Of course if <i>a</i> is 1, then you only have a constant function.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So increasing, decreasing, constant.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The next point is there are several laws of exponents.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you have <i>a</I>^(<i>x</i> + <i>y</i>), then that’s the same as <i>a</i>^<i>x</i> * <i>a</i>^<i>y</i>.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If you have a difference like <i>a</i>^(<i>x</i> – <i>y</i>),

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
then you simply divide to get (<i>a</i>^<i>x</i>)/(<i>a</i>^<i>y</i>).

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you have (<i>a</i>^<i>x</i>)^<I>y</i>, then you simply multiply the exponents

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and you get <i>a</i>^(<i>x</i> * <i>y</i>) like over here.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Finally if you have (<i>a</i> * <i>b</i>)^<i>x</i>,

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that’s the same as <i>a</i>^<i>x</i> * <i>b</i>^<i>x</i> like over here.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay. Now let’s talk a little bit about some deeper properties.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
First of all, the exponential function is always continuous,

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
which means that there are no breaks in its graph.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The domain of the function is all real numbers,

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and the range is from 0 to ∞.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But of course what happens to the function

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
when you approach infinity depends upon the value of <i>a</i>.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If <i>a</i> is greater than 1, then as you approach ∞,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you get an infinite value.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
As you approach –∞, you get 0.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Just the opposite happens if you have a number <i>a</I> between 0 and 1.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now when you approach ∞, you get a 0;

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
when you approach –∞, you get ∞.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay. On to the derivatives of these functions.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The point is that the derivative of <i>a</I>^<i>x</i>

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is not <i>x</I> * <i>a</i>^(<i>x</i> – 1) as you might think,

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but in fact it is <i>a</i>^<i>x</i> * Log[<i>a</i>].

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Here’s the derivative from D.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now the question is in which case does this logarithm term become 1?

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That happens when the number <i>a</i> has got a special value called <i>e</i>,

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and this <i>e</i> is named in honor of

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If you solve Log[<i>x</i>] = 1 with the Solve function,

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you get back that <i>x</i> is actually <i>e</i>.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In the Wolfram Language, we use E for the number

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and use Exp to represent the exponential function

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
whose derivative is <i>e</I>^<i>x</i>.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The point is that this is the one function whose derivative is itself.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You just get back <i>e</i>^<i>x</i> when you try and differentiate it.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Of course if you’ve got something more complicated like over here,

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
then you can use the chain rule and get back the answer.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How about integrals?

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, the integral of <i>e</i>^<i>x</i> is, again, <i>e</I>^<i>x</i>, plus of course the <i>C</i>.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But if you have a more general exponential function <i>a</i>^<i>x</i>,

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
then you get back <i>a</i>^<i>x</i>/Log[<i>a</i>].

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay. Let’s go a step deeper into the number <i>e</i>.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There are many ways to define <i>e</I>.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The simplest one is of course to just say that

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
<i>e</i> is a number for which the Log[<i>x</i>] = 1,

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
but you can also define it using limits.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This limit over here becomes 1 when <i>x</i> is <i>e</i>.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So does the other limit over here, which really is the sequence limit.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
<i>n</i> is a natural number, so when <i>n</i> becomes very large,

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
then ((1 + 1)/<i>n</I>)^<i>n</i> becomes <i>e</i>.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Also, the area under the curve 1/<i>x</i> from 1 to <i>a</i>

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
becomes 1 when <i>a</I> is the number <i>e</i>.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Finally, you should know that

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the approximate value of <i>e</i> is about 2.71828.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That’s a very important approximation

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
well worth memorizing.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The number <i>e</i> is really, really important

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in mathematics, science and engineering,

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and you will come across it all the time

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
when you try and apply mathematics to practical situations.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
As examples of where it occurs,

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
we can talk about exponential growth or decay.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Now, for example, you’ve got bacteria,

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and initially there are 10 bacteria,

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and then they double every hour.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That’s the law of growth.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That’s the initial number.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That’s the growth rate.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Here’s a plot showing that we actually have

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
exponential growth in this case.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But on the other hand, if you have a radioactive material,

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
then you begin with some quantity like over here, and the quantity,

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
let’s say, halves every time  period,

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
then you have radioactive decay.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There’s growth and there’s decay, and both of them can be modeled

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
very nicely using exponential functions.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
To summarize, an exponential function is

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
a function is of the type <i>a</i>^<i>x</i>.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If <i>a</i> is greater than 1, it’s increasing.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If <i>a</I> is less than 1, it is decreasing.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Of course there are many laws of exponents

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
which are useful in practice.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now in general, the derivative and integral

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
for an exponential function are constant multiples of the function,

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but the special number <i>e</i> has a property that <i>e</i>^<i>x</i>

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
has got integral and derivative both equal <i>e</i>^<i>x</i>

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
plus of course the constant <i>C</i> for the integral.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The number <i>e</i> is really useful in many different fields.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
For example, you can talk about exponential growth and decay,

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and you might want to use the number <i>e</i>

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
or some other base for the exponential.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In the next lesson we’ll talk about logarithmic functions,

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
but before that, do revise today’s lesson.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It’s an important lesson.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Exponential functions are got all the time,

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and you should know them really well.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
