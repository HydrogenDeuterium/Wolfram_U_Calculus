00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 34 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is logarithmic functions.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the subject.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In the last lesson, we talked about exponential functions

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
like this one, 2^<i>x</i>.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here is a plot of the function.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The question is suppose we want to solve the equation 2^<i>x</i> = 5.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The problem here is that 5 is not a power of 2 in any obvious way,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so we give it to Solve, and then Solve comes back and tells us

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that <i>x</i> is Log[5]/Log[2].

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That’s the answer given by Solve, and really speaking,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it’s the logarithm of 5 to the base 2.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That’s an example of a logarithm.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This lesson will talk about these logarithmic functions

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in more detail and some of their properties.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Basically,  a logarithm is an inverse function

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
because it is the inverse of an exponential function <i>a</i>^<i>x</i>.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can think of it as having the property that

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
<i>a</i> raised to the logarithm of <i>x</I> to the base <i>a</i> is <i>x</i>,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and so is the logarithm of <i>a</i>^<i>x</i> in the base <i>a</i>.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The number <i>a</i> is the base of the logarithm.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now we have a function called Log in the Wolfram Language

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
which does these calculations.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The log of 27 to the base 3 is 3 because because 3^3 is 27,

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and the logarithm of 1/4^–2 is –2.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Keep in mind that the default base for Log is <i>e</i>,

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
so the logarithm of <i>e</i>^2 is just 2.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That’s the natural logarithm which is implemented

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
in the Wolfram Language with base <i>e</I>.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Next let’s take the graph of a logarithm function.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here’s the graph, and you’ll notice that it’s defined

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
only for positive <i>x</i>, and the range is all the way from –∞ up to ∞.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The function domain for the logarithm is just the positive numbers,

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and the range is all the real numbers.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now if you look at the limits when <i>x</I> approaches ∞,

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
then you see that the answer is ∞, and when it approaches 0,

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the answer is –∞.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Of course the graph intersects the <i>x</i> axis at <i>x</i> = 1.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay. Next let’s take an example

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
where you have a base which is less than 1.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now the opposite happens.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You have a function which is still defined on positive numbers,

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but it shoots up to ∞ at 0 and goes down to –∞ on the other side.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Domain and range is just the same as before,

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
but now the limits are the opposite,

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so when you approach ∞, you get –∞.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
When you approach 0, you get ∞.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That’s the behavior of a logarithm whose base is less than 1.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Finally, the plot has the same <i>x</i> intercept at <i>x</i> = 1.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now the point is that when you have inverse functions,

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
then their graphs are reflections of each other in the line <i>y</I> = <i>x</i>.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
For example, if you take E^<i>x</I> and Log[<i>x</i>],

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then they are inverse functions, and if you look at their graphs,

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
then they are reflections of each other in the line <i>y</i> = <i>x</i>.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Just the same happens if you take <i>e</I>^–<i>x</i>,

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and you see that again you have a reflection,

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but that’s slightly harder to see.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The red plot is reflected in the line <i>y</I> = <i>x</i> to give you the blue plot.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now of course there are lots of properties

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
of the exponential function,

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and in just the same way, you have properties of the logarithm.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So Log[<i>x</I> * <i>y</i>] is Log[<i>x</i>] + Log[<i>y</i>].

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But if you have quotients like <i>x</I>/<i>y</i>, then they turn into differences.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Finally if you have powers, then they turn into multiplication.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The log of <i>x</i>^<i>b</i> is <i>b</i> times the log of <i>x</i>.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The point is that logarithms are really useful

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because they convert multiplication to addition,

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
they convert division to subtraction

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and they convert powers to multiplication.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now an important rule is the change of base

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
where if you have a base <i>x</i>, you can change to base <i>a</i>

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
by this kind of a quotient.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The logarithm <i>y</i> to the base <i>x</i> is

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the logarithm of <i>y</i> to the base <i>a</i>

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
divided by the logarithm of <i>x</i> to the base <i>a</i>.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay. For example, when you get back this answer from Solve,

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
then that really is the logarithm of 5 to the base 2.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay. At long last, we can talk about

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the derivatives and integrals of logarithms.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The derivative for Log[<i>x</i>] is just 1/<i>x</i>.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That’s a very nice property, very surprising.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But the fact is that logarithms grow more slowly than polynomials.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because you have a change of base formula,

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
you can work out the derivative of

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the logarithm of <i>x</i> to the base <i>a</i> as 1/(<i>x</i>Log[<i>a</i>]).

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You can apply the chain rule

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and work out more complicated derivatives.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Here is a plot of the logarithm and its derivative.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Notice that the logarithm function is only defined for positive <i>x</i>

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
whereas its derivative is defined for all <i>x</i>,

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and that’s an issue which we’ll come back to later in the lesson.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How about the integral of log?

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, the integral of log is <i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>] – <i>x</i>,

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and that’s a bit hard to prove,

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but you can check the answer by doing a derivative,

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and you get back the usual function.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The integral of the natural logarithm is <i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>] – <i>x</i>.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Here is a plot of the integral.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay. Now an important application.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The integral of 1/<i>x</i> is possible to compute, but for that,

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you need to worry about the fact that the logarithm function

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is only defined for positive <i>x</i> whereas 1/<i>x</i> is defined for all <i>x</i>.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
To work out that difficulty, what we’ll do is we’ll introduce

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
a logarithm of the absolute value of <i>x</i>.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now that’s nicely defined for all numbers, except of course for 0.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Once you have done that, then you can see that the integral of 1/<i>x</i>

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
is the logarithm of the absolute value of <i>x</i>,

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but in the Wolfram Language, the Log function

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
can handle both positive and negative numbers.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For example, the Log[–2] is the Log[2] plus a complex number.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So in the Wolfram Language, the integral of 1/<i>x</i> is just Log[<i>x</i>].

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But in fact, one could write it as Log[|<i>x</i>|] + <i>C</i>.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay. Finally, let’s talk about an application.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Here is an exponential decay function.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The <i>n</i> over here is a quantity at time <i>t</i> = 0, and the question is

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
how long would it take for the function

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to reach half of its initial value?

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, to do that, we solve the equation and get back an answer,

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and this answer is called the half-life of the function.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The λ is called the decay constant.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It tells you how fast it decays.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
1/λ is called the mean lifetime of the function.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Often when you do such calculations,

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you will need to know the logarithm of 2.

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The numerical value is approximately 0.693,

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and that’s well worth memorizing.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
With that, we come to the end of this lesson,

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the main point being that logarithms are very useful

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
in solving exponential equations of this type.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Just like you have properties of exponentials,

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
you also have properties of logarithms.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The derivative of a logarithm of <i>x</i> is 1/<i>x</i>.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The integral is a lot harder.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It is <i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>] – <i>x</i> + <i>C</i>.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The integral of 1/<i>x</I> is Log[|<i>x</i>|] + <i>C</i>.

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Of course, you can use logarithms

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to find the half-life of a function.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That’s a brief introduction to logarithms—

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
enough for us to now start talking about

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
the so-called L’Hospital’s rule, which we’ll do next time.

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
