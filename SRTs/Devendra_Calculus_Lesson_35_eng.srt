00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 35

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The topic for this lesson is L’Hospital’s rule.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let’s being with a brief overview of the lesson.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let’s say you have a continuous function like <i>x</i>^2

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I ask you to find the limit as <i>x</i> approaches 5.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What you could simply do is to plug in the value 5

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in the function expression and you’ll get back the correct answer,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which is of course 25 in this case.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But if the function has a point discontinuity,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then this would not work.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For example, over here for <i>g</i>, there is an issue at 1

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because the denominator becomes 0.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you try and find the value at 1,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
then you get back an indeterminate answer.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now of course in this case, what you could do is

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to simplify the function algebraically like I’ve done over here,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and then things work just fine.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If I now plug in <i>x</I> = 1,

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I get back the limit of the function <i>g</I> when <i>x</i> goes to 1.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But there are functions for which this will not work.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
For example, you have <i>h</i> over here, which is Log[<i>x</i> – 1]/(<i>x</i> – 2),

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and simplifying <i>h</i> makes no difference.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The question is what do you do in such a case?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In such a case, you can apply something called L’Hospital’s rule,

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and that is the theme for this lesson, L’Hospital’s rule.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay. Before going on to the rule itself,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
let’s talk about so-called indeterminate forms.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let’s say you have a function <i>f</i> which is Sin[<i>x</i>] and <i>g</i> which is <i>x</i>.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now you try and work out the ratio <i>f</I>[0]/<i>g</i>[0],

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and you get back an indeterminate.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That’s an indeterminacy of the form 0/0

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
because both the values are 0 at 0.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you take the function <i>h</i> over here, then that’s (2<i>x</i> – 1)/(3<i>x</i> + 2),

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and if you plug in <i>x</i> = ∞, you get back something like ∞/∞,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
so that’s again an indeterminacy.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Next if we take the function <i>y</i> over here,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
then at 0 you have a 0 times ∞ over here,

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
so that’s an indeterminacy of the type 0 times ∞.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When you try and evaluate it, you get back indeterminate.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Finally if you take the function <i>z</I>—that’s Csc[<i>x</i>] – Cot[<i>x</i>]—

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and again at 0, you have ∞ – ∞.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That’s a problem.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When you try and evaluate it, you get back indeterminate.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The point is that you will have situations in which

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the system gives you back indeterminate,

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and then the question is how do you find limits in such cases?

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
As I said earlier on, the way to do that

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
is to find the limits using L’Hospital’s rule.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
L’Hospital’s rule says that if you have a ratio <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]/<i>g</I>[<i>x</i>]

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and you want to work out the value of that limit as <i>x</I> approaches <i>a</i>,

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
then what you do is you simply work out the limit of <i>f</i>'[<i>x</I>]/<i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>]

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
at that value <i>a</i>—assuming of course that that limit exists.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You can reduce a problem to a problem of computing

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the limit of a quotient of derivatives.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
For example, in our function from the introduction,

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you had Log[<i>x</I> – 1]/(<i>x</i> – 2) when <i>x</i> approaches 2,

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and you see over here that when you actually take

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the derivative and take the ratio of those two,

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
things are much better.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can plug in <i>x</i> = 2, and you get back the answer of 1.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can confirm the answer with Limit,

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and you do get back the same result, 1.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
L’Hospital’s rule is a very powerful rule which says

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
if you need to find the value of the limit <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]/<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>],

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
you simply find the derivatives of the numerator

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and denominator separately and then plug in the values if that works.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay. As an example of 0/0,

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
let’s go back to our ratio <i>f</I>[<i>x</i>]/<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>], Sin[<i>x</i>]/<i>x</i>.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Now you see over here that individually you have 0/0,

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
but then if you take derivatives, things get much better

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and you get back Cos[<i>x</i>], which has a nice value at 0,

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
namely, it has 1.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The limit of <i>f</i>[<I>x</i>]/<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>], Sin[<i>x</i>]/<i>x</i>, is just 1.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That’s a very nice and important result.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay. Next.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you go on to ∞/∞ like with the function <i>h</i>,

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
then you have (2<i>x</I> – 1)/(3<i>x</i> + 2).

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You work out the limits, and they are both ∞.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But if you could take derivatives and take a quotient,

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
then you just get back 2/3,

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and so the limit of the function <i>h</i> is just 2/3.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Next, go on to the type 0 * ∞ for the function <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>].

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now in this case you don’t really have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]/<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>],

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
so you write it as <i>e</i>^(1/<i>x</i>)/(1/<i>x</i>) and take the derivatives.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then if you plug in <i>x</i> = 0, you do get back the answer ∞ from above.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That’s the limit for <i>y</i> at 0 from above.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Here’s a plot which shows quite clearly that at 0,

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the function does approach ∞ if you go from the right,

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
if you go from above.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay. On to ∞ – ∞ for the function <i>z</I>[<i>x</i>].

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now in this case, what you do is you first of all simplify.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Write the cosecant as 1/Sin[<i>x</i>] and cotangent as Cos[<i>x</i>]/Sin[<i>x</i>]

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and get back a ratio.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you work out those two limits separately, you get back 0/0,

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
but then if you work them out in terms of derivatives,

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you get back Tan[<i>x</i>], which is just 0 at 0,

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
so the answer for the limit is just 0.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay. Now in some cases, you apply L’Hospital’s rule

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
more than once to get the answer.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
For example, here’s a function <i>f</I> defined to be <i>e</i>^<i>x</i>/3<i>x</i>^2.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If we try and apply L’Hospital’s rule once at ∞,

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
then you get back ∞/∞ again.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That’s again indeterminate, so what you do is

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you apply L’Hospital again, and now things look good

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
because you get back ∞/6, which is ∞,

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
so the answer for the limit is ∞.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can apply L’Hospital’s rule repeatedly,

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
but of course it’s going to be more time-consuming

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and more expensive to do so.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay. Now some more indeterminate forms.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We have ∞^0 to begin with.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Here’s an example.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let’s say we have <i>x</i>^(1/<i>x</i>).

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you plug in <i>x</i> goes to ∞, you get ∞^0, so that’s an indeterminacy.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What you do in this case is you apply a logarithm,

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and when you do that, then you get back

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
something which is going to be much more tractable

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
because the law of logarithms says this is Log[<i>x</I>]/<i>x</i>.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Then what you do is you plug in the derivatives over here,

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and you get back 1/<i>x</i>.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
When <i>x</i> approaches ∞, the answer is just 0, so Log[<i>y</i>] = 0,

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
which says that the limit is going to be just 1.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That’s a plot of the function

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
showing you it approaches 1 as <i>x</i> approaches ∞.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
As another example, let’s take 0^0.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
When you take <i>x</i>^<i>x</i> and apply 0 to it, you get back 0^0,

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but then again, you think of it as being a logarithmic case,

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
so apply logarithms and you get back <i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>] like over here.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Then write that as Log[<i>x</i>]/(1/<i>x</i>), apply L’Hospital

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and you get back that when <i>x</i> = 0, the answer is 0,

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
so the original limit is just going to be <i>e</i>^0 = 1.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Finally, let’s take the case where you’ve got 1^∞.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
When you’re at π/2, this function becomes 1—Sin[π/2] is 1—

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
raised to Tan[π/2] is ∞, so that’s 1^∞.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Again, you need to to some logarithmic work.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You say let’s take logarithms.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You get Log[Sin[<i>x</i>]^Tan[<i>x</i>]].

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Pull down the Tan[<i>x</i>]—it’s a power—then apply L’Hospital like before.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You plug in π/2, and things look better.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The answer is 0 for the logarithm, and so the actual limit is 1.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of this lesson.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Basically L’Hospital’s rule is very useful

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
when you have indeterminate forms of the type,

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
let’s say, 0/0 and ∞/∞.

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But of course if you’ve got something like 0^∞ or other things,

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you can work too.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let’s say with some algebraic manipulation, you can tackle

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the case where you have 0 * ∞ and ∞ – ∞.

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you take logarithms, then you can also tackle the cases

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
where you have ∞^0, 0^0 and 1^∞.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Of course sometimes you need to apply L’Hospital’s rule

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
multiple times to arrive at a suitable answer.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That’s the end of this lesson.

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The next lesson will talk about slope fields and Euler’s method,

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
but before we do that, do revise L’Hospital’s rule.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It’s a very important rule, a very useful rule,

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and you surely will benefit a lot from review.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
