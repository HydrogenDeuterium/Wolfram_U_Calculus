00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 36

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The topic for this lesson is slope fields and Euler’s method.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The fact is that some differential equations

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
are very difficult to solve by hand.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For example, here’s a differential equation that looks quite simple,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
<i>y</i>'[<i>x</i>] = <i>y</i>[<i>x</i>]^2 – <i>x</i>, and you want to solve it

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
with the condition that when <i>x</i> = 1, then <i>y</i> = 0.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now the function DSolve can certainly solve this equation,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but the solution is huge

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and involves these so-called Bessel functions,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which occur in the oscillations of membranes and elsewhere.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In such cases, it is much easier to just visualize

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
what the solution to the curve looks like for any initial value.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In this lesson, we’ll learn how to use slope fields

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to see the behavior of such differential equations.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
As an introduction to slope fields,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
let’s consider the differential equation <i>y</I>'[<i>x</i>] = <i>f</i>[<i>x</I>, <i>y</i>].

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you want to find the slope field for this equation,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
what you do is you plug in the values for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in the function <i>f</i> and then plot the slope at that point.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What does that mean?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It means that you draw a small line segment

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
with slope close to the value you get from the expression <i>f</I>[<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>].

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Then you get a slope field, which gives you a very general picture

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
of the solutions to the differential equation.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It’s not very precise, but it’s good enough.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Luckily we have two functions in the Wolfram Language.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There’s StreamPlot and VectorPlot, which can be used for this purpose.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
For example, let’s go back to the earlier differential equation,

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and you can use VectorPlot by saying {1, <i>f</I>[<i>x</i>, y]} over here,

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
or StreamPlot with the same kind of specification,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and you get back the vector field,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the slope field over here and the stream field over there.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The stream field has a solution of curves

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
instead of just the arrows like over here.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now in some cases, what we really want

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
are the particular solutions to a differential equation.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
For example, in the first case for our introduction,

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
we had the differential equation with the initial value <i>y</i>[1] = 0.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
To find that out, you can use the StreamPoints option like over here

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and get the particular solution curve

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
on the vector plot or on the stream plot.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A couple more examples.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Here is the vector field for <i>x</I> – <i>y</i>, the stream plot.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You see over here that when <i>x</i> is very large,

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
then you have a positive slope from the expression over here.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When <i>y</i> is very large, you have a negative slope.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The same thing can be worked out with VectorPlot over here

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
with the initial value <i>y</i>[0] = 0.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay. Another example.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let’s take <i>f</i> to be <i>x</i> * <i>y</i>.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now what happens over here is the stream plot

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
depends upon where you are.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you are in the first or the third quadrant,

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
then both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the same sign,

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
so you have positive slopes,

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and just the opposite happens in the other two quadrants.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If you want the particular solution <i>y</I>[1] = –1,

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you plug that over here in StreamPoints

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and you get back the plot for that particular curve.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay. Now in practice, you might just want to estimate

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the solution for a differential equation,

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and that can be done with Euler’s method.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The idea is this.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Here’s the same example from the introduction,

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and you want to find the value at 2

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
starting with the value at 1 equal to 0.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What you do is you start with (1, 0)

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and plug it in the slope over here, so the slope is –1.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then write down the linear approximation, which is <i>y</i> = –(<i>x</i> – 1).

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you plug in 2, then the approximate value is –1.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But of course what you could do is

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you could go off a little bit on the tangent line,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
then change direction,

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and then that will give you a better approximation.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
For example, you could go halfway from 1 to 2 up to 1.5,

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and then you could change your direction with the new slope,

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and you get a better approximation

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
from the linear approximation over here,

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and you get back the solution at 2 to be –0.125.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Here’s the idea behind Euler’s method.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The idea is that when you take very short steps along tangent lines,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you get much better estimates.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Basically what you’ll do is

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you’ll use an equation of this type over here

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
where every value of <i>y</i> depends upon the previous value.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Here’s a visual for the case where <i>y</i>' = <i>y</i> and <i>y</i>[0] = 1.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Of course in this case, the exact solution is just <i>e</I>^<i>x</i>

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
because its derivative is itself.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you have only one point, then you get back just a tangent line,

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the red line over here.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you take two points, you go halfway down,

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
then you change direction and you get a better approximation.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then of course you could take three points, four points, et cetera.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
By the time we get to ten points like the green line over here,

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
then you get a really nice approximation.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Of course the top-most graph is the actual solution.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
With Euler’s method, the approximation improves

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
as you take more and more points.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You have one point, then two points, then ten points

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and then you get closer and closer to the solution.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Now Euler’s method relies on so-called recurrence relations.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What’s that?

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, here’s the relation for Euler’s method, and what happens is

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
let’s say you want to find the value of <i>y</i>2—so <i>n</i> is 2.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then that depends upon <i>y</i>1 and <i>x</i>1.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You need <i>x</I>1 and <I>y</i>1 to work out the value of <i>y</i>2.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then you say I don’t know the value of <i>y</i>1,

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
so to find the value of <I>y</i>1, you need the value of <i>x</i>0 and <i>y</i>0.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But of course, those are just the initial conditions.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In practice, if you want to find, let’s say, <i>y</i>100,

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you need to go around all the way to 0,

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and that’s of course a very tiresome thing to do by hand.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
On the other hand, it’s a perfect thing to do by computer,

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
so it’s very easy to program on a computer.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
After a couple of lessons, we’ll talk about how to make

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
a program that calculates the points from Euler’s method.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That’s the end of this lesson, and the main point is

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
you can use slope fields to visualize

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
the behavior of differential equations.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We have two nice functions.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We have VectorPlot and we have StreamPlot to plot these slope fields.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can use Euler’s method

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
to estimate the solution at various points,

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and because that’s rather tedious to do,

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
we can actually program it with a computer,

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
but that you’ll learn very soon.

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The next lesson is about separable differential equations.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Before we do that, do review today’s lesson.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It’s an important lesson for differential equations.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
