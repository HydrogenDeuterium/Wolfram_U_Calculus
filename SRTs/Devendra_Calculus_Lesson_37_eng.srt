00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 37

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is separable differential equations.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The fact is that most differential equations cannot be solved easily.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For example, here’s a nonlinear equation.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What I mean by that is that you’ve got <i>y</I>[<i>x</i>]^2 over here,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and DSolve can solve the equation, but the solution is rather messy

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and involves these so-called Bessel functions,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which occur in the oscillations of drums and elsewhere.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In contrast to that, there are other equations

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
where you actually can find a simple solution.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here’s an example where the solution is quite simple,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and if you look over here, in part it’s because

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the differential equation itself is a bit simpler.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is an example of a separable differential equation.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The theme of this lesson is to talk about

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
these separable differential equations.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The question is what is a separable differential equation?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, a separable differential equation is

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
an equation of the form <i>y</i>', the derivative of <i>y</i>,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
equal to some function of <i>x</I> times some function of <i>y</i>.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay. Now if you look at this,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the right-hand side is certainly what you’d call separable.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can separate <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The question is how about the left-hand side?

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, recall that <i>y</i>' is <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>,

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
so we can think of that as a separation for <i>y</i>'.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
For example, here is the differential equation

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that we spoke about in an earlier slide, and if you want to solve it,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
you replace <i>y</i>' by <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and then you separate your variables like over here.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You have (1/<i>y</i>)<i>dy</i> = <i>xdx</i> like you do in algebra.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then you integrate both the sides.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then you say that this <i>y</i> is <i>e</i>^(<i>C</i> + (<i>x</i>^2/2)),

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but that’s the same as <i>e</i>^<i>C</i> * <i>e</i>^(<i>x</i>^2/2),

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and then that itself with <i>e</i>^<i>C</i>

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
is another constant which we will call <i>K</i>.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The solution is <i>y</i> equal to some constant times <i>e</i>^(<i>x</i>^2/2).

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That is the general solution of the differential equation.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay. On to another example.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let’s try and solve the differential equation <i>y</i>' = <i>y</i>.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In this case, you can think of <i>f</i>[<i>x</I>] = 1 and <i>g</i>[<i>y</i>] = <I>y</i>,

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so that’s the separation of the right-hand side.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Keep in mind that <i>y</i>' is <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>, so you separate your variables,

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
rearrange and you get <i>dy</I>/<i>y</i> = <i>1dx</i>.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Then you integrate both sides.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I haven’t put the constant, but it’s certainly there in the background.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So <i>y</I> is <i>e</i>^(<i>x</i> + <i>C</i>) where <i>C</i> is a constant,

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
so you get <i>e</I>^<i>C</i> * <i>e</i>^<i>x</i>.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That’s <i>K</i> * <i>e</i>^<i>x</i>.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You can confirm the answer with DSolveValue,

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and you get back just the same result.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay. On to a slightly harder example

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
where you have <i>y</i>' = 3<i>x</i>^3/(4<i>y</i> + Sin[<i>y</i>]).

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In this case, <i>f</i> is just the numerator,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and for <i>g</i>, you can take 1 over the denominator.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That’s the differential equation,

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and then you separate the variables and rearrange.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Integrate both the sides separately, and now we see that

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the solution is going to be 2<i>y</i>^2 – Cos[<i>y</I>] = (3<i>x</i>^4)/4 + <i>C</i>.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Here is a plot of the solution with ContourPlot.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay. The question is what happens when there are initial values?

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let’s take the equation <i>y</i>' = <i>x</i> * <i>y</i>

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
with the initial condition <i>y</i>[0] = <i>1</i>.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That’s an initial value problem with a value of <i>y</i> given at 0.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The question is can you then find a particular solution

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
of this differential equation?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let’s rearrange the equation as earlier.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Solve it, so you get <i>y</i> equal to <i>K</i>, where <i>K</i> is a constant,

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
times <i>e</i>^(<i>x</i>^2/2).

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now we plug in the initial values.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You get <i>y</i>[0] = 1, so you get 1 = <i>K</i> * <i>e</i>^0, so <i>K</i> = 1.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The solution is <i>y</i> = <i>e</i>^(<i>x</i>^2/2).

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can confirm that with DSolve.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can also check the solution plot by doing a StreamPlot.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay. On to some applications, and we’ll take two of them.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The first one is for current.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Here’s an equation that describes a circuit

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in which there’s some charge flowing, some resistance,

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
some capacitance and some voltage—that’s supposed to be circuit.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That’s the equation, the differential equation, for the charge <i>q</i>.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now of course if <i>v</I> depends on <i>t</i>, that’s much harder,

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
so we’ll assume that <i>v</i> itself is a constant,

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so we’ve got constant resistance, capacitance and voltage.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In that situation where <i>v</I> does not depend upon <i>t</i>,

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you can solve for <i>q</i>', and then you see that

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
things are separable over here.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You separate the equation and get an expression for <i>t</i>

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
in terms of everything else, but we want to solve for <i>q</i>.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You solve for <i>q</i>.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The Normal here just means you’re ignoring some conditions on <i>q</i>.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The solution is <i>c</I> times <I>v</i>

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
minus <i>e</i> raised to that expression over there,

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but if you think about this, it’s really <i>e</i>^(–<i>k</i>/<i>c</i>) * <i>e</i>^(–<i>t</i>/<i>r</i>).

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That’s just <i>K</i> * <i>e</i>^–<i>t</i>(<i>c</i> * <i>r</i>).

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
One final point.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
As the time approaches ∞ as more and more time goes by,

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the value of <i>e</i>^–∞ = 0, so this term, drops out,

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and the final solution is that the charge approaches <i>c</i> * <i>v</i>

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
as <i>t</i> approaches ∞.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
A second example is for Newton’s law of cooling.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Here is a differential equation for the temperature

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
when an object at temperature <i>t</i>0 initially is placed in a medium

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
where the temperature is held constant at <i>s</i>.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What happens is that the rate of change of temperature

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is proportional to the difference between the current temperature

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and the temperature of the surroundings.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
As time goes by and the difference becomes small,

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the rate falls down as well.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You need to determine <i>k</i>.

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We’re given the initial condition that the temperature at 0 is <i>t</i>0.

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now of course over here we have a separable equation,

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
so you separate the variables and you get back

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
an expression for <i>t</i> in terms of temperature,

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but you want to solve for temperature,

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
so you do that and you get an answer.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Now the point is that <i>e</i>^(<i>c</i> * <i>k</i>) is a constant,

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
so again you can call that some <i>c</i> and you solve for that constant.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The final solution is that the solution for the temperature at time <i>t</i>

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
is (–<i>s</i> + <i>t</I>0)<i>e</i>^(<i>k</I> * <i>t</i>) + <i>s</i>.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can check the answer with DSolve,

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and you get back the same expression.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Now the question is how to determine <i>k</i>.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
To find <i>k</i>, what you need is the temperature <i>t</i>1 at some later time τ.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Suppose we know that temperature.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Then we plug the values in into the solution

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and you solve for <i>k</i>, and that is the expression for <i>k</i>.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The constant <i>k</i> is Log[(<i>s</i> – <i>t</i>1)/(<i>s</i> – <i>t</i>0)]/τ.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
As an application, let’s say you have got

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
a cup of boiling coffee at 100 ºC.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It’s boiling.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You put it in a room in which the temperature is 22 ºC.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let’s say an hour later, the temperature of the coffee is 60 ºC.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Then what you can do is you can model the coffee temperature

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
by the equation over here where I’ve plugged in the value of <i>k</i>

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
based on the given information.

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That is the starting temperature, that’s the room temperature,

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and you want to model the coffee over a period of time.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let’s see what happens to it over a period of, let’s say, 10 hours.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You can see that the temperature slowly approaches

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the room temperature, which is 22, and in fact,

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you can use Limit to check that the answer is actually 22

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
when you have let infinitely many hours pass by.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That’s Newton’s law which models the cooling of objects

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
which are placed in a room with a higher temperature

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
than room temperature.

148
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of this lesson,

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and the main point is that separable equations are,

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
in general, rather easy to solve.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The way that you solve them is to note that

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the right-hand side is a function of <i>x</i> times a function of <i>y</i>,

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and then you can replace <i>y</i>' by differentials <i>dy</i> and <i>dx</i>

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and then solve the equation.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Now of course you can use that to model the various phenomena.

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
For example, you can model the charge in a circuit

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
by a separable differential equation,

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
or you can model the temperature over time for a hot object

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
using separable differential equations.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about how we can make programs

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
that help to solve calculus problems

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
when doing differential equations.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But before that, do revise today’s lesson.

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It’s quite an important topic, separable differential equations.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I’ll see you in the next lesson.

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
