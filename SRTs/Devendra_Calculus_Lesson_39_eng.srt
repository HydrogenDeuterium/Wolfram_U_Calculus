00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 39

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The topic for this lesson is part 1 of a sample calculus exam.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this course, we have gone over lots of topics

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in both differential calculus and integral calculus.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It’s now time to talk about some exam problems

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to apply what you have learned.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The questions I’ll take in this lesson

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
are similar to what you might see on the AP Calculus AB exam,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but equally well, you might see the questions on other exams

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that you might take anywhere in the world

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
at an introductory calculus level.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let’s begin with the first question,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
which says find the derivative of this function over here at 2.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There are two steps over here:

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
first, find the derivative,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and secondly, plug in <i>x</i> = 2.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now to find the derivative,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
what you do is you apply the quotient rule—

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
after all, you have a fraction over there.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The rule says that

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you find the denominator times the derivative of the numerator

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
minus numerator times derivative of the denominator

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
divided by denominator squared.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then of course you plug in the value 2.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That’s what I’m doing over here.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Then you get back the answer, and you can check the answer with D.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You get back just the same result.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
On to question 2, which says calculate the limit

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
of this function over here at 5.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now each term in the function is continuous at 5.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The limit laws say that you can simply plug in the value 5

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and work out the answer, so the answer is just 610 – 6Log[5].

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You can check that with Limit and you get back just the same result.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here’s a plot which confirms that you actually have

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the limiting value at that point.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
On to number 3, which says calculate the integral

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
from π to 5 of Cos[<i>x</i>] + 1/<i>x</i>.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now if you apply the fundamental theorem of calculus,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
then you first find the antiderivative, which is Sin[<i>x</i>] + Log[<i>x</i>].

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You plug in the upper limit and the lower limit and you subtract,

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and you get back the answer.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can confirm the answer with Integrate,

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which gives you just the same result.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Here is a plot of the region that we just integrated.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
On to number 4, which says find the value of <i>c</i>

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
which satisfies the mean value theorem for this function.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What you need to do is to work out the value of <i>c</i>

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
for which you get the mean value for the slope,

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
basically, at that point <i>c</i>.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
First of all, you work out the slope

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
of the line joining the endpoints.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That’s 13.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Solve the equation—

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
derivative of the function equal to 13 in the given range.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You get back <i>x</i> as √(7/3).

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Work out the function value.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Basically you have a point

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
at which the mean value theorem is satisfied,

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and you can check that with a plot over here.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You see that at that point,

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the tangent line has got the same slope

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
as the line joining the endpoints.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
On to number 5, which says find the general solution

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
of this differential equation.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now that’s a separable differential equation

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
because you can separate <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>,

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
so what you do is think of <i>y</i>' as being <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and separate the two sides, and you get back the answer,

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
which you can rewrite as just Exp[Log[–1 + <i>y</i>^2]] = Exp[3<i>x</i>^2 + <i>c</i>].

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You have a solution over here, which is <i>y</i>^2 – 1 = <i>c</i> * <i>e</i>^3<i>x</i>^2.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can plot that solution for different values of <i>c</i>,

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and here you see that there are all the different solutions.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That’s a separable differential equation

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
which you can solve by simple integration.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Next let’s try and find the limit of this function over here at ∞.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now at ∞, you need to only worry about

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the degrees of the numerator and denominator.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now in this case, they’re the same.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They’re both 3, so you simply need to work with those terms.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The answer is going to be 10<i>x</i>^3/3<i>x</i>^3.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That gives you just 10/3.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can check the answer with Limit,

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and you do get back just the same result.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Here is a plot to visualize what’s happening,

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and you do see that the value approaches 10/3, 3.33,

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
as <i>x</i> approaches ∞.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
On to number 7, which says use the trapezoidal rule

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to estimate the integral over here.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now you are required to use five trapezoids,

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
so what you do is you find the width of each trapezoid

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
by doing upper limit minus lower limit over 5,

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
so you get back 8/5 as the width of each trapezoid.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You then work out the approximate integral

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
by adding the areas of these trapezoids.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Here is the calculation, and I get back the answer 2314.03.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Compare that with Integrate.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It’s only somewhat close, but not very precise.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Here is a plot which shows the actual area

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and the trapezoidal approximation.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay. On to question 8, which says find the equation of the line

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
tangent to the graph of this function at (1, –2).

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Now the first step, of course, is to find the slope at that point.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You work out the derivative, which is just <i>e</i>^(<i>x</i> – 1) – 3.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Plug in <i>x</i> = 1 and you get back the slope as –2.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You can check that with D.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Basically you work out the derivative and plug in <i>x</i> = 1,

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and you do get back the same answer.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
By the point-slope formula, the equation on the tangent line

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is going to be <i>y</i> minus <i>y</i>1 equal to slope times <i>x</i> minus <i>x</i>1.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Here is a plot which shows that you indeed have the correct solution.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
On to number 9, which says for what value of <i>a</i>

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
is this function over here continuous?

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now this is a piecewise function.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There are two pieces.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There is the part where <i>x</i> is less than 2 and the remaining part,

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and the only question is what happens at 2 itself.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, for the function to be continuous, the limit from the left at 2

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
should be equal to the limit from the right at 2.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You solve the equation for that,

122
00:07:24,000
 --> 00:07:27,000
which is limit as you approach from the left

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
equal to limit from the right.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Solve that for <i>a</i>, and you get back <i>a</i> as –1.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If <i>a</i> is –1, then you actually have continuity.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Here’s a plot which shows you that

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you indeed have no break in the graph when <i>a</i> is –1.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You see over here that <i>a</i> is –1.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
On to number 10, which says find the approximate value

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
of this square root to four decimal places.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, keep in mind that the number given to you is very close to √144,

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
so that’s 12, so you need to work with the function √<i>x</i>

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
as the underlying function at the point (144, 12).

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You first work out the slope at that point.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Write the equation of the tangent line,

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and then use that to write the approximation,

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
which is going to be 12 plus the difference over here over 24.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let’s check how it compares with the actual value.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You see over here that you actually have

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
an error which is in the tenth millions.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay. Let’s go on to number 11,

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
which says find the volume of the solid,

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
which you can obtain by rotating this function around the <i>y</i> axis.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then you bound it by the <i>y</i> axis itself

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and the line <i>x</i> = 2 and the <i>x</i> axis.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Here’s a plot of the region.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now in this case because you’re revolving around the <i>y</i>,

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you use the cylindrical shell method.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Basically you have cylinders of radii <i>x</i> and height –<i>x</i>^3 + 5<i>x</i>,

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
so that’s the integral to be computed over here.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There’s 2π<i>r</i> * <i>hdx</i>.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Work it out with Integrate, and you get back the volume required.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
On to number 12, which says find the extrema of this function

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
on the interval [2, 6] using the closed interval method.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now because you have a polynomial, it’s in fact differentiable,

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
so the first step is to find the critical numbers,

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and those are the numbers with slope 0.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What you do is you find a derivative, set it equal to 0

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and solve in the given interval for the values of <i>x</i>.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We just find one value, <i>x</i> is 3, so you must check at 2, at 3 and at 6.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Here’s the function.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Work out the value at those three points, and you see now that

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you have a maximum over here and a minimum over there,

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
so you have a maximum at (3, –9) and a minimum at (6, –108).

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can check that with a plot.

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can see you have a maximum at 3 and a minimum at 6.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
On to number 13, which says find the derivative

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
of this function over here.

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now the function has two terms, so for the first term,

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you use the product rule, and you get back the first term

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
times derivative of second term

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
plus second term times derivative of first.

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Then you work out the second-term derivative in the same way.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Get the answer, and then by the difference rule for derivatives,

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you simply subtract them like over here to get back the final result.

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can check that with D,

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and you see that it does just the same thing.

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That brings me to the end of the first part

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
of the sample calculus exam.

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Do review it.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
These are not very difficult questions.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The next part will have some more challenging questions,

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
but by then,

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I hope you’ll be ready to take up those more difficult questions.

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
