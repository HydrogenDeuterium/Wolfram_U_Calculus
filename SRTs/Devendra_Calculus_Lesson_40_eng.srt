00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 40

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The topic for this lesson is part 2 of a sample calculus exam.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Like I said earlier on, this is the second part of the calculus exam

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that I’ll present now.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
As in part 1, which we presented last time,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the questions over here are very similar to what you might find

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
on the AP Calculus AB exam, but of course the questions over here

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
will be somewhat more difficult than the ones in the first part.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In fact, there are a couple of them which are really quite involved.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I’ll warn you a little more at that time,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but do pay careful attention.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is the hard part of the exam.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let’s begin with question 14, where we left off last time.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The question is calculate the limit

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of this expression over here at <i>h</i> = 0.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now the point is that it looks like a limit, no doubt,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but if you look at the expression very carefully,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
it’s really a derivative,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and in fact, it’s a derivative of Sec[<i>x</i>] at π/3—

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
after all, it’s like f[<i>x</I>] + <i>h</i> – f[<i>x</i>]/<i>h</i>.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you work out the derivative of secant,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that’s secant times tangent,

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so you would expect the answer to be 2√3.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let’s check that with D.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You find the derivative of Sec[<i>x</I>] and plug in <i>x</i> as π/3,

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and you do get back the expected answer.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Or you could use Limit and find the answer,

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and you get back just the same result.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let’s move on to question 15, which says that a disk was measured

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to have a radius of 9 cm.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The error was around 0.04 cm.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The question is find the error in the area.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You’ve got two variables—you’ve got the radius and the area—

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and they are related by <i>A</i> = π<i>r</i>^2.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now if that’s the relation, then the differentials, the errors

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
are related by <i>dA</I> = 2π<i>rdr</i> by taking derivatives,

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so what you do is you recall that from the information given to you,

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that <i>r</i> is 9, <i>dr</i> is 0.04—that’s the error—so now the error in the area

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
would be 2π times <i>r</I> times <i>dr</i>, and so the answer is 2.26 roughly.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay. On to number 16, which says find the derivative of Log[<i>x</i>^2 – 3].

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now that looks like something for which you need the chain rule,

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
so what you do is you find the derivative of log,

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
which is 1/(<i>x</i>^2 – 3),

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and then multiply by the derivative of <i>x</I>^2 – 3, which is 2<i>x</i>.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That’s the final answer.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can check it with D, and you do get back just the same result.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
On to number 17, which says calculate the third derivative

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
of the expression over here, 3<i>x</i>^4 – Cos[<i>x</i>] + <i>e</i>^2<i>x</i>.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What you do is you work out the first derivative,

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
which is 12<i>x</i>^3 from 3<i>x</I>^4, plus Sin[<i>x</i>] from the second term

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and 2<i>e</i>^2<i>x</i> from the third term.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Check that with D, then start here and work out the second derivative,

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
which is Cos[<i>x</I>] from the Sin[<i>x</I>], then 36<i>x</i>^2 from the from the 12<i>x</I>^3

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and 4<i>e</I>^2<i>x</i> from the first term over here.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let’s check that with D again, the second derivative,

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
then work out the third derivative

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
as the derivative of this expression over here.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Then you get back –Sin[<i>x</I>] from the Cos[<i>x</i>],

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
you get back 72<i>x</i> from here

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and you get back an 8<i>e</i>^2<i>x</i> from the first term.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then you check that with D, taking the third derivative,

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and you get back the answer.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay. On to number 18, which says that the region bounded by <i>x</i> + 2

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and the quadratic over here is rotated around the <i>x</i> axis.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The question is to find the volume of the solid

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
made by this rotation.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Here is a plot.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You have a straight line and a parabola, an upward parabola,

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and the question is where do these two intersect?

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, what you do is you use Solve

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and find out where the straight line and the curve intersect.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You get a lower limit and an upper limit.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now if you let <i>f</i> be the first function and <i>g</i> be the second function,

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
then clearly <i>f</i> is below <i>g</i>.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Because you are rotating around the <i>x</i> axis,

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you might want to use the washer method over here.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That tells you you must use π(<i>g</i>(<i>x</i>)^2 – f(<i>x</i>)^2)<i>dx</i> inside.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If you do the integral over here using Integrate,

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you get back the final answer for the problem.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
On to number 19, which says find the limit of this quotient over here.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now as a first step, what you could do is you’re working at 0,

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
so you plug in 0 for both the numerator and the denominator,

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and what you find is that in fact, you have a 0/0 situation.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That’s an indeterminacy,

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
so that should remind you of L’Hospital’s rule,

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
which says that you work out the derivatives of

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the numerator and denominator separately,

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
plug in <i>x</i> goes to 0, and you get back 5/3,

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
which is the correct answer, as you can check with Limit.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Here is a plot which confirms that you indeed have

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
the correct answer for the limit.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
On to number 20, which says to calculate

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the integral over here from 2 to 3.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Now that looks like the case of the substitution rule

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
because you need to put the denominator <i>u</I> equal to <i>x</i>^2 – 1.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If you work out the derivative, you get <i>du</i> = 2<i>xdx</i>.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then you need to change the endpoints—

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
after all, you’re going from <i>x</i> to <i>u</i>.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When <i>x</i> is 2, then <i>u</i> is 3.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When <i>x</i> is 3, then 3^2 – 1 is 8,

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
so that’s the new integral over here,

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
which turns out to be 3/2 * Log[8/3].

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can check the answer with Integrate,

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and you do get back just the same result.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Here is a plot which shows the area which you just computed.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
On to number 21, which says find <i>y</I>' if <i>y</i>^2 + <i>x</i> * <i>y</i> = 2.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The point is because you need to work with <i>y</i>^2,

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
we should use implicit differentiation.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What you do is you work out the derivative

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
of each term in the equation separately.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That’s the derivative of <i>y</i>^2,

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and the second term over here has got

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
a derivative with the product rule,

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and of course the right-hand side has the derivative 0.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You work out the derivative for each term separately,

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
so you get 2<i>ydy</i>/<i>dx</i> from here,

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and then you try and simplify the answer.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You get <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i> = –<i>y</i>(2<i>y</i> + <i>x</i>).

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Of course you can do the same thing in the Wolfram Language,

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and you get back the value for <i>y</I>' at the point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>),

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
which is –<i>y</i>[<i>x</i>]/(<i>x</I> + 2<i>y</i>[<i>x</i>]).

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
On to number 22, which says find the equation

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
of the normal to this curve at (–2, –4).

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now keep in mind that the normal is really

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
the perpendicular to the curve at the point,

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
so you first work out the slope at that point.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When I say slope, I mean the derivative,

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and the derivative of this curve is just <i>x</i> + 3,

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
so you plug in the value for <i>x</i> and you get the slope as 1.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But that’s for the tangent,

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
so the normal line will have slope –1 from here.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You write down the equation of the normal at that point,

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and you get the equation <i>y</i> = –<i>x</i> – 6.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Here is a plot which shows the given normal.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You have the curve over here and the normal over there.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay. On to number 23, which says for what value of <i>a</i> and <i>b</I>

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
will this function over here become differentiable?

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Basically you have a piecewise function

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
because there are two pieces over here,

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and they both meet at –1 provided <i>a</I> and <i>b</i> have got the right values.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Now you want your function to be differentiable,

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
so there are two conditions.

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
First of all, the left-hand derivative at –1

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
should equal the right-hand derivative, and secondly,

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the left-hand limit at –1 should equal the right-hand limit.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Now for the first condition, if you differentiate over here,

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you get <i>a</i> = 3<i>b</i>(–1)^2 – 4(–1),

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and the second relation over here for the limits

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
will just be obtained by putting in <i>x</i> = –1.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You solve those two for <i>a</I> and <i>b</i>,

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
so that says that <i>a</i> is 11/2 and <i>b</I> is 1/2.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Then the function is differentiable.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Here is the graph of this function,

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and you can see that it’s nice and smooth at the required point, –1.

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
On to number 24, which says a particle moves

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
according to the velocity <i>v</I>(<i>t</i>) = 4sin(<i>t</i>)cos(<i>t</i>).

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The question is find the total distance that it travels

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
from 0 to π in seconds.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
To do that you must work out the integral,

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but you must ignore the sign because you want a distance,

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
so you have an absolute value over here.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Use the Integrate function with the absolute value,

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and you get back the answer as 4.

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Here’s a plot which shows the distance that you have found.

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Of course keep in mind that the negative area, in this case,

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
was counted as positive because we want the distance traveled.

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
On to one of the most difficult questions for this exam, number 25,

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that will occupy two slides, so do pay careful attention.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The question is a cylindrical can has got a volume of 216 cm^3.

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The question is find a value for the radius

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
that will minimize the amount of material used.

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Now if you make a can, then the material will cover the surface,

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
so you’re talking about surface area of the can.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Now surface area has got two parts.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
One is the top and bottom areas, which give you 2π<i>r</i>^2,

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and the side area, which is 2π<i>rh</I>,

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
so the total surface area is 2π<i>rh</I> + 2π<i>r</i>^2.

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But keep in mind that you have two variables, <i>r</i> and <i>h</i>,

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
so you must eliminate one of them.

182
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know that π<i>r</I>^2<i>h</i> is 216—after all, that’s given to you over here.

183
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can solve for <i>h</i> in terms of <i>r</i>,

184
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and now the surface area no longer depends upon <i>h</I>.

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It only depends upon <i>r</I>,

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and that is the starting point for the second part of the problem.

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Now what we do is we start with the expression for the surface area

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and try and minimize it with respect to <i>r</i>.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What you do is you take the derivative, set it equal to 0

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and you solve, and you get back <i>r</I> as roughly 3.25

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and exactly it is 3 times the cubed root of 4/π.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Now let’s check that you have a minimum,

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
so work out the second derivative at that value of <i>r</I>.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It looks positive, so you have a minimum.

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Basically the can will use the least amount of material

196
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
when the radius is around 3.25 cm.

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
On to the final question for the exam, this sample exam.

198
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You have a spherical balloon that’s losing air at a certain rate.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The question is find the rate at which the radius is decreasing

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
when the radius is 10 cm.

201
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Now keep in mind that you actually have a relation

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
volume and radius, which is <i>V</I> = 4π<i>r</i>^3/3 for the sphere.

203
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If you find the derivative, you get <i>dV</I>/<i>dt</i> from there

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
equal to 4π<i>r</I>^2 <i>dr</i>/<i>dt</i>.

205
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That’s just the differential version of the relation.

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay. Now you know the value of <i>dV</i>/<i>dt</i> as –2,

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
so you can work out the value of <i>dr</i>/<i>dt</i> by solving,

208
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and you get back the answer as –1/200π.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The radius is decreasing—after all, you have a negative answer—

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
at a rate of 1/200π cm/sec.

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of this sample exam,

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and also to the end of the course.

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It’s been a great pleasure to teach you.

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
From here on, we wish you all the best.

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
From all of us here at Wolfram U,

216
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
good luck, and thank you.
