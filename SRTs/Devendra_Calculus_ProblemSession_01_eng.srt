00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 1 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Our topic for today is limits and functions. Now before I go on, I just want to say that

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we’ll have several problem sessions, and the idea would be to try and solve problems,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but also to review the concepts done in the last few lessons. We will talk about limits,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which is kind of a fundamental topic for calculus, and also we’ll talk about functions,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which were talked about early on in the course. Let’s begin with problem number 1.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You want to find a limit of <i>x</i>^2 + 2 as <i>x</i> approaches 5. Now this is just a polynomial,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
so you can plug in <i>x</i> = 5. 5^2 + 2 = 27, and you can check the answer with Limit.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The answer is 27. Finally, you can do a plot and make sure that

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the value actually looks like it is 27. That’s a 27 over there.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
On problem 2, you want to find the limit of Sin[2<i>x</i> − 1] as <i>x</i> approaches π/6.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now just as a review and also to check things carefully, let’s first look at

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the left-hand limit from below, and the answer is √3/2 − 1. You get the same answer for

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the right-hand limit, and in fact Limit tells you that the answer is exactly what we got early on.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Here’s a plot, and the numerical answer is around −0.2.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay. Problem number 3. You want to find the limit of the Log[<i>x</i>] to the base 2 minus <i>e</i>^5<i>x</i>,

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and if you work it out with the left-hand limit, you get the answer 3 − <i>e</i>^40.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That’s a large negative number. You get the same answer with the right-hand limit.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Notice I’m using FullSimplify to make it a little simpler. You get the same answer with Limit,

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
so that’s the answer for the limit. The numerical value is about 10^17 with a negative sign.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can check the answer on the plot, and there it is.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The answer is about −2.35, to be more precise, times 10^17.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay. Now we go on to an example where things go wrong. You want to find the limit of 3/<i>x</i>

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
as <i>x</i> approaches 0, and clearly there’s a problem because when <i>x</i> is 0,

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
then the denominator becomes 0. If you find the left-hand limit, the answer is −∞.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The right-hand limit is ∞, so clearly the limit does not exist, and the answer is actually indeterminate.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Here’s a plot which shows that indeed the function approaches ∞ as you go to 0 from the right

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and −∞ when you go to 0 from the left, so that’s the answer.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The answer of the limit is just indeterminate; it does not exist.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay. Number 5. Now we have a rational function. The problem over here is that if you look at

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the denominator over here, it’s <i>x</i>^2 − 7<i>x</i> + 10, but at 2, the denominator is 0,

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
so we cannot apply the quotient law for limits directly. What you should do first

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
is to simplify the function—in this case, factor it. Simplify will do that for you,

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and then when you plug in the value <i>x</i> = 2, you get back the answer −1, and that’s exactly the limit

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
for the function at 2. Namely, it’s −1. You can check the answer with the plot,

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and you do get the answer −1 with the plot as well. For rational functions,

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you may need to do a bit of simplification before you actually find the limit.

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Problem number 6. You are given a rational function, but this time things are a bit simpler

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
because the numerator has limit 17 on plugging in, the denominator has 20 on plugging in

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and you can therefore use a quotient law to get the limit by simple division.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here’s the answer from Limit, which is exactly the same. You can plot the function,

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and it does look like that’s the correct answer.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay. Now Let’s go on to talking about things that are more complicated. You want to find

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the left-hand limit of <i>x</i> over its absolute value when <i>x</i> approaches 0 from the left-hand side.

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now when <i>x</i> is negative, of course, that over here is negative <i>x</i>. You would expect that

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the answer is −1. You can confirm the answer with Limit. You get −1.

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can check the answer over here, and the answer is indeed −1.

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you approach from the left the answer is −1, and from the right it is 1.

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Question number 8. You want to find the limit of <i>x</i> * <i>e</i>^1/(<i>x</i> − 4) when <i>x</i> approaches 4 from the right.

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now what happens over there is when <i>x</i> is slightly larger than 4, that’s a very small positive number,

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
so you get a very large number over here. That’s what the table tells you:

52
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that the answer’s probably going to be ∞. Those are very, very large numbers.

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can confirm the answer with Limit and get ∞. This right-hand limit is actually ∞,

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and you can check the answer with a plot. Indeed it is ∞.

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay. Moving on now, let’s take piecewise limits. Here you have got a piecewise function,

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but it’s only different at a single point, so that’s not going to affect the limit.

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Here’s the function in Mathematica form, the Wolfram Language form,

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and the left-hand limit is 4. If we just plug in the values, the right-hand limit is also 4,

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and together, the limit is again 4. For a piecewise function, there is no difficulty

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
if it’s only different at a single point, and the plot confirms that. Surely the value

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
is different at 2 itself, but around 2, near 2, there is a nice, smooth behavior.

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay. Things go slightly wrong in the next example because now we have got a piecewise function

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:19,000
with two large pieces. If you are at −3, then on the left you use that expression over there to get −8;

64
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
on the right, use the second expression and you get 6. You’ve got a left-hand limit of −8,

65
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
a right-hand limit of 6, and together they tell you that the limit does not exist.

66
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We can confirm that with a plot. You have two pieces, but at the point of interest, they actually have

67
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
a very different limit from the right and from the left, so the answer is indeterminate.

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay. Now the last few questions are about domains and ranges of our functions.

69
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The question is to find the domain of this function. Well, it’s very simple because

70
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the Cos function is defined everywhere, 2<i>x</i> is defined everywhere,

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
so together they give you the function domain as being everything, the whole real line.

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
FunctionDomain says True, which means that the function is defined everywhere. If you plot it,

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
then indeed there is no problem at all. This function has domain equal to the set of real numbers.

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Going a step further, let’s try and find the domain of (<i>x</i>^2 − 2)/(<i>x</i>^2 − 4),

75
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and clearly the problem is only when the denominator is 0. Now <i>x</i>^2 − 4 is 0 when <i>x</i> is either 2 or −2.

76
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You can check that with Factor or with Solve. The only problematic points are 2 and −2,

77
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so it looks like the domain is either to the left of 2 or between −2 and 2 or between 2 and ∞.

78
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can check that function domain, which says that the domain is either <i>x</i> less than −2,

79
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
or <i>x</i> lying between −2 and 2, or <i>x</i> to the right of 2. Here’s a plot,

80
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and quite clearly there are three pieces: one to the left of −2, one between −2 and 2

81
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and one to the right of 2.

82
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay. Now on to ranges. The question is compute the range of <i>x</i>^3. Well, <i>x</i>^3 is an odd polynomial,

83
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
so its range is all real numbers. You can confirm that with the function Range, which says True.

84
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The plot says that in fact you can cover everything below and above,

85
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
so the range is all real the numbers.

86
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
On to the last problem, which is to do the range of Sec[<i>x</i>]. Now because secant is the reciprocal of cosine

87
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and because cosine goes between 1 and −1—here’s a plot to confirm that—

88
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,000
then clearly the range of secant must be to the left of −1, the right of 1 and of course we can have

89
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
both the values over here included. The function range is either <i>y</i> less than or equal to −1

90
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
or <i>y</i> greater than or equal to 1. Here’s a plot which confirms that, and you leave out

91
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
everything between −1 and 1 on the <i>y</i> axis, and the rest are all okay.

92
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This brings me to the end of today’s problem session. I hope you have had a nice review for concepts.

93
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Next time, in Lesson 6, we go on to continuity, but before that, do try the short quiz, Quiz 1,

94
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
which deals with the first few lessons. Review what you’ve learned so far,

95
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and next time we’ll go on to continuity in Lesson 6. Thank you.
