00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 4 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is rates and approximations.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let’s begin with problem 1, which talks about the approximate value of √24.9.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The problem is to find an approximate value using a linear approximation.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The relevant function over here is √<i>x</i>, and you want to work at <i>x</i> = 25

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because that’s very close to 24.9. We first find the derivative of the square root function

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
at that value of <i>x</i>, and then we work out the actual approximation by doing the value at 25

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
plus the derivative times the difference between 24.9 and 25, and you get back the answer of 4.99.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you check, the difference between the exact and approximate values is of the order of −5.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Here’s a graph of both the function and the approximation, and you can see

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it’s quite a nice approximation close to 25.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay. Number 2 asks to approximate the value of −Cot[29º]. The first step is

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
we decide to work at 30º, which is π/6 radians. That’s close enough to 29.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then we of course convert the 29º into radians. We work at the slope at 30 at π/6.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That turns out to be 4. Plug that 4 into the linear approximation formula. You have value at 30º

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
plus slope times the difference, and you get back the approximate value, and the approximation is

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
of the order of −3. It’s a good approximation. Here is a plot of the graph at the approximation.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay. Problem 3 asks you to find the approximate value of 1.001^50.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We think of this as being related to the function (1 + <i>x</i>)^50 around <i>x</I> = 0. First we find

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the derivative at 0 for that function. Plug in the derivative into the approximation formula.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Get back the approximation value and check that the approximation is quite good.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Once again, here is a plot of both the function and the tangent line of the approximation at 0.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay. On to the next problem, number 4, which asks you to work with a spherical ball

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
whose radius is 5 cm. You know that the error in the radius is 0.01 cm, and you want to find

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the error in the surface area. The surface area of a sphere is 4π<i>r</i>^2, so you want to find the error.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You work with differentials, and the differential in this case is 8π<i>rdr</i>—

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
that’s 8π<i>r</i> from the derivative, and <i>dr</i> is for the differential. You plug in the values—

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>r</i> equal to 5, <i>dr</i> equal to 0.01—and you get back that the estimated error

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
is about 1.26 cm^2 for the surface area.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For number 5, we’re given a cone whose height is 5 cm and the radius is 9 cm.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now it is known that the height has an error of plus or minus 0.02 cm, and the question is

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to find the error in the volume. That’s the formula for the volume of a cone. It’s 1/3π<i>r</i>^2<i>h</i>.

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Keep in mind that the radius is fixed, so to find the derivative with respect to <i>h</i>, I get π<i>r</i>^2<i>dh</i>/3.

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Then you plug in the values given to you—<i>r</i> is 9, <i>h</i> is 0.02—and you get back that

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the estimated error for the volume is around 1.70 cm^3.

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
On number 6, there is a 10-foot ladder, and it is falling down a wall at a rate of 0.5 ft/sec.

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The question is what is the rate at which the bottom of that ladder is sliding out at the point

38
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
when it is 6 feet from the wall? That’s the picture you have over here.

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That’s the bottom, and that’s the ladder falling down the wall. The length of the ladder is 10 feet.

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The first point to note is that you have the Pythagorean relation—<i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]^2 + <i>y</i>[<i>t</i>]^2 = 100, in this case.

41
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You take the derivative of that equation with respect to <i>t</i>. Keep in mind that you already know

42
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that the value of <i>x</i> is 6 ft. The value of <i>y</i> is 8 ft by Pythagoras. <i>y</i>'[<i>t</i>] is given to you,

43
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:01,000
so you can plug in the values over here and work out <i>x</i>'[<i>t</i>] as 0.667, or roughly 2/3 ft/sec.

44
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay. On to number 7, which talks about a melting ice cube. This ice cube has the volume decreasing

45
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
at 1 cm^3/sec. The question is to find the rate at which the sides of the cube

46
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
are decreasing at the point where the volume is 512 cm^3. Now of course, the volume of a cube

47
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is the side cubed, so when the volume is 512, the side is 8 cm. You take a derivative of that formula

48
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
with respect to <i>t</i>, and then you know that <i>V</i>'[<i>t</i>] is −1 because volume is decreasing. <i>s</i> is 8.

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You plug in the values, and you find that the sides are decreasing at the rate of −1/192 cm/sec.

50
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Number 8 talks about a car that’s going north from an intersection at a certain speed, 50 mph,

51
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and a truck is going west from the same intersection at 40 mph. The question is to find out

52
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the rate at which the distance between these two is increasing after an hour.

53
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That’s the picture you have. That’s the car going north, the truck going west

54
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and that’s the distance between them. Of course, the Pythagorean theorem says that

55
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the car squared plus truck squared is equal to distance squared. That’s the equation.

56
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If we plug in the values, you’ll find that after an hour, the distance is √4100. Take the derivative,

57
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and keep in mind that after one hour, the car has a derivative of about 50 distance and rate

58
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
With the truck, you have 40 for the same quantities, and the distance is 10√41.

59
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If you plug in values, you get that the actual distance between them is increasing at 10√41.

60
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Number 9 talks about a spherical balloon that’s being inflated at 30π cm^3/sec.

61
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The question is to find the rate at which the surface area is increasing when the balloon has

62
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a radius of 8 cm. Now the surface area is given by <i>S</i> = 4π<i>r</i>^2, so if you take the derivative,

63
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you get <i>S</i>'[<i>t</i>] = 8π<i>r</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>r</i>'[<i>t</i>]. The problem is you need to find <i>r</i>', the derivative of <i>r</i> with respect to <i>t</i>,

64
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and to do that, you use a volume formula, you find the derivative and you plug in

65
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the given information for the rate of inflation of the balloon and the radius.

66
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You find that the derivative for <i>r</i> is 15/128. You plug in that into the formula for

67
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
the derivative of the surface area, and you get back 15π/2 as the required rate.

68
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay. Number 10 talks about an inverted conical tank that’s being filled with water

69
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:02,000
at a rate of 40π m^3/sec. The base of this tank has a radius of 100 m, and the height is 250 m.

70
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The question is to find the rate at which the water level is increasing when the water is 70 m deep.

71
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Now keep in mind that you can talk about similar triangles over here and get that the ratio

72
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
between radius and height is always constant. In fact, that ratio is 2/5. You can plug in

73
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that ratio into the volume formula for the cone and get the volume in terms of the height and the width.

74
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Then if you differentiate the equation, that tells you the relationship between the derivative

75
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:56,000
for the volume and the derivative for the water level. Given that <i>V</i>'[<i>t</i>] is 40 and <i>h</i> is 70,

76
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
what you can do is you can plug back those values and find the rate at which

77
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the water level is increasing when the water is 70 m deep.

78
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay. The remaining questions for this session are all simple, and I hope you will find that too.

79
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I certainly think that they are much simpler than the earlier ones, and in each case,

80
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you simply need to do a simple derivative calculation and get the answer.

81
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A car’s position on a highway is given by the function over here for number 11, and the question is

82
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
to find the velocity function and the velocity after three hours. The velocity function is simply

83
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the derivative of the position function. That’s the answer, and if you plug in the value of <i>t</i> = 3,

84
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
then you get back the velocity after 3 hours. Here is a plot of the position and velocity.

85
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let’s go on now to number 12, where you’re given the cost function for a company when it produces <i>x</i> units,

86
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and you want the cost of making the 51st unit. That should remind you of the marginal cost,

87
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
which is the derivative of the cost function. Let’s work that out. Plug in 50

88
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,000
because the marginal cost when <i>x</i> is 50 is the cost of making the 51st unit. The answer is 0.28.

89
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That’s approximately the cost of making the 51st unit.

90
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Here are plots of the cost and the marginal cost for this company.

91
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay. Number 13 says that the amount of charge going through a particular wire is given by

92
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the equation over here. The question is to find the current going through it when the time is π/6.

93
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Keep in mind that the current is simply the derivative of the charge. When <i>t</i> is π/6,

94
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that’s the answer, and here are plots of the charge and the current.

95
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
On to problem number 14 where it says you have got a cannonball,

96
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and that cannonball has got its height function given by this formula over here.

97
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The question is to find the velocity at 1 second and when it hits the ground again.

98
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
After 1 second, the velocity is given by the derivative at that time. Now we want to find

99
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
when the cannonball hits the ground again. Well, that’s a question of solving the equation over here.

100
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Simply put the height equal to 0. If you work it out, we get back that <i>t</i> is 3.06, roughly.

101
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Then you work out the velocity at that point. That’s −30. Here’s a plot of the cannonball

102
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and the velocity at any time <i>t</i>, and you can see that when <i>t</i> is given as time over here

103
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
when it hits the ground, then the velocity is around −30.

104
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That brings me to the end of this problem session, and we’ll next talk about maxima and minima.

105
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Before that, do try Quiz 4 and be ready for the next lesson. Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
