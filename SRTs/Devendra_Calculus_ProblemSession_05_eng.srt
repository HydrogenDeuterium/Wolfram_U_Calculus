00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 5 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The topic for this session is maxima and minima, the mean value theorem and curve sketching.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let’s begin with the first problem for the session. You have the function 2<i>x</i> – <i>x</i>^2,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the problem is to find the absolute maximum and minimum for this function

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
on the interval [0, 4]. What you do is you first of all work out the critical numbers

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
by setting the derivative equal to 0. There’s only one critical number at 1, so you need to test at 0;

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the left-hand point at 1, which is a critical point; and at the right-hand point, 4.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When you do that, then the function values tell you that you actually have an absolute maximum at 1

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and you have an absolute minimum at 4. Here’s a plot of the function clearly showing you

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that you have a maximum at 1 and a minimum at 4.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay. For the second example, let’s talk about local maxima and minima

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
for this polynomial over here. To find the local maxima and minima,

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
you first work out the critical points as before. There are three of them, so what you do is

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you examine the intervals to the left and right of each of them. At –2, the first critical point,

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you pick a point to the left and to the right, et cetera, and work out derivatives over there.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You find that in the first case, the derivative goes from negative to positive, et cetera,

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so you have a local minimum at –2 and 6 and a local maximum at 5/2.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Here is a plot of the function, and you can see quite clearly that

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you do have local minima at –2 and 6, and you do have a local maximum at 5/2.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now it’s much easier in general to use the second derivative test, so let’s talk about that now.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You have a function, and you want to work out the local maxima and minima

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
using the second derivative test. Work out the critical points. There’s just two of them, –4 and 1,

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so then you work out the second derivatives at those points. In the first case,

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
you have a negative second derivative, so that says that you actually have a maximum at <i>x</i> = –4,

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and you have a positive second derivative, so that says you have a local minimum at <i>x</i> = 1.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Here is a plot of the function showing the local maximum and the local minimum as we just found out.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
On to number 4, which talks about the local maxima and minima for

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the absolute value function 2 – 3<i>x</i>. Now this function of course does not have a derivative at 2/3,

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
so we need to examine that as a critical number, and apart from that,

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
we have no other points where the derivative is 0. What you do is let’s talk about (2/3, 0)

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and check what happens to the left of it, the right of it.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The derivatives are negative in the first case and positive in the second case,

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
so you have a local minimum at <i>x</i> = 2/3. Here’s a plot. Of course in this case,

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
you could have guessed the answer, but it’s good to know that you can actually

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
apply the same ideas from derivatives to find the local minimum in this case.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay. On to number 5, and now we switch to the mean value theorem.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We have the function Sin[<i>x</I>] + <i>x</i>, and the question is how do we find the value at which

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the tangent line actually has the same slope as the secant line joining endpoints.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Here’s the function. That’s the slope of the secant line joining the endpoints.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What you want to do is to find a point at which the derivative is equal to the slope,

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
which we just found out, and there are two of them. There’s –π/2 and π/2.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You work out the values at those points. You’ve got two points at which

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the tangent line is parallel to the secant line joining the endpoints.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Here’s a plot that illustrates that, and you actually see that

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you have the two values we just found out over here.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay. On number 6, the same thing, the mean value theorem. You have a function 3/(<i>x</i> – 1),

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and you want to find out a point at which the tangent line has a slope equal to the secant slope.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You have the slope of the secant. You set that equal to the tangent slope,

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and you find that that happens when <i>x</i> is √5, so the value of <i>f</i>[√5] is –1 + (3/√5).

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Here’s a plot that shows the secant line and the tangent line

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
at the point at which the two are parallel.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay. On to number 7, which talks about the asymptotes of a rational function.

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Now of course the vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator becomes 0.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You solve that equation, and you find that there are two of them.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because you have the same degree for the numerator and denominator,

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you actually will have a horizontal asymptote.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let’s confirm that Limit confirms our guess of 1/2 after we got a 1 over here

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
for the coefficient and 2 over there, so the horizontal asymptote is <i>y</i> = 1/2.

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Here’s a plot showing that you actually do have the two vertical asymptotes

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and one horizontal asymptote.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay. Problem number 8—another problem with asymptotes.

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now you work out the vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to 0,

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and there are three of them. On the other hand, because the numerator degree

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
is one greater than the denominator—you’ve got a power of 4 over there and 3 over there,

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
so there will be a slant asymptote. To find the slant asymptote,

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you actually use the polynomial coefficient with PolynomialQuotient,

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and you get that as the expression <i>y</i> = –(11/25) + (3<i>x</i>/5).

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Here’s a plot which confirms all the information and shows you the slant asymptote as well.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay. Let’s go on to problem number 9, which is a slightly more qualitative problem.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Here you’re given the graph of a derivative of a function, and the question is

71
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
what can you say about the original function from this information?

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, you see over here that the derivative is positive over there and over there,

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
so it’s positive between (–3, 0) and (2, ∞), and it is negative on the remaining two intervals.

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You have a local minimum near –3 and also near 2 because if you look at –3,

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
then it goes from being negative to being positive, and you have a local maximum at 0

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
because the derivative goes from being positive to being negative.

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Finally you have a local maximum for the derivative near –2

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and a local minimum for the derivative near 1, so you actually have inflection points there.

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
In all, you have three local minima and maxima and two inflection points.

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Here are all the five points. The black points are the minima and maxima

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and the blue points are the inflection points.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay. On to number 10, which talks about finding the points of inflection

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
for this function <i>x</i>Cos[<i>x</i>] between –π and π. What you do is you set the second derivative to 0

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and solve between –π and π, and you find that the numerical values are 0, –2.28 and 2.28 roughly.

85
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then you work out the second derivatives at suitable points, and you find over here

86
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that the second derivative changes sign in each case, as you see over here,

87
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and so you actually do have an inflection point at all those candidates.

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Here is a plot which confirms that you actually do have three inflection points for this function.

89
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay. On to number 11, which is a rather simple problem.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The question is given the position of a particle, you want to find where the velocity is at maximum.

91
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Now if the velocity has to be maximum, then the acceleration has to be 0 at that time,

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
so we set the acceleration to be 0, and you find that that happens when <i>t</i> = –2/3.

93
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Now you work out the acceleration at two points over there, and you find that

94
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the acceleration goes from being positive to negative at this point,

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so you actually have a maximum over there.

96
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay. That’s the picture you have where you are seeing the velocity being maximal.

97
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay. On number 12, you have to compute the value of <i>x</i>

98
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
for which the function has a minimum at <i>x</i> = 2.

99
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You’ve got a parameter <i>c</I>, so you want to find the value of that <i>c</i>.

100
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You set the derivative to 0, and you find that <i>x</i> should either be –√<i>c</i> or √<i>c</i>,

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
but if you want a critical point at 2, then that √<i>c</i> better be 2, so <i>c</i> must be 4.

102
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Here’s a plot that confirms that you actually have the correct behavior in this case;

103
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
namely, you do have a local minimum at <i>x</i> = 2.

104
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay. On to number 13, where you’re given a table of values.

105
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Now let’s say this function given to you over here is differentiable. The question is

106
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
what is the minimum number of times that the derivative becomes 0?

107
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, if you look over here, then the derivative first decreases from 1 to 3.

108
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It also decreases from 5 to 10, and it increases between 3 and 5.

109
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The derivative must be 0 at least twice on this interval.

110
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Here’s a plot which confirms that

111
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you actually have two points at which the derivative is 0.

112
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay. On to the last question, which is about computing the places on this curve

113
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
where you have a horizontal tangent.

114
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Now of course you have an implicit function, so you must differentiate implicitly in this case.

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You do that, work out derivatives.

116
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Now if that is to be 0, then the numerator must be 0, so you must have <i>x</i>(10 + 3<i>x</i>) = 0

117
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
so either <i>x</i> is 0. Now if <i>x</i> is 0, then <i>y</i> too is 0 from the equation,

118
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
but then the derivative is not defined over there because you’re dividing by 0,

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
so that can’t happen. On the other hand, when <i>x</i> = –(10/3),

120
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
which  comes from this factor over here, then you can actually work out the value of <i>y</i>,

121
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and you get two values, so in fact, you’ve got two points on the curve

122
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
at which the tangent is horizontal.

123
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Here’s a picture of the curve showing you the two points at which

124
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
you have these horizontal tangents.

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That brings me to the end of today’s problem session.

126
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I’ll stop over here and see you next time.

127
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you.
