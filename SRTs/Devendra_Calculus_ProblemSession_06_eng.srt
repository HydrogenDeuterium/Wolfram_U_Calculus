00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 6 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The topic of this session is optimization, antiderivatives and Riemann sums.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let’s begin with problem number 1 for the session.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A rectangle has its base on the <I>x</I> axis and the upper two corners lie on a parabola.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The question is compute the largest possible area of that rectangle.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here’s a picture. Here’s the parabola and the rectangle,

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and if you think of this portion as being <i>x</i>, then the rectangle has base 2<i>x</I>,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and the height is 6 – <i>x</i>^2—after all, you are on a parabola.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The area function is 2<i>x</I>(6 – <i>x</i>^2).

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What you do is you compute the critical numbers

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
by setting the derivative equal to 0,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and you find that <i>x</i> is either √2 or –√2.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You work out the area at those two points.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That’s obviously the maximum area, 8√2,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and this occurs when the base is 2√2 and the height is 4.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
All that’s clear from the information over here.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay. Number 2.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The question is to compute the closest point

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
on the curve <i>x</i>^2 – <i>y</i>^2 = 3 to the point (1, 2).

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Obviously we need to use the distance formula like over here

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and you’re computing to the point (1, 2), but the main point is that

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
you can actually minimize the square and get just the same answer.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Here’s the square distance, and we plug in <i>y</i> as being √(<i>x</i>^2 – 3)

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
because <i>y</i> follows the equation over here,

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and you work out the distance function in terms of <i>x</i>.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Compute the critical numbers by setting the derivative equal to 0,

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and you get back two answers.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can check that. The second one is

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the one that’s going to give you the nearest point.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Work out the corresponding <i>y</i> values, and then this value of <i>y</i>,

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
which is positive and paired with 2.16574, is clearly the point

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
at which you will have the minimum distance.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The closest point is roughly (2.16, 1.30), and here is a picture

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
showing the points on the curve and the given point.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay. Problem number 3.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The question is a window consists of an open rectangle topped by a semicircle,

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and it has a perimeter of 100 cm.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The question is compute the radius of that semicircle

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
so that you get the maximum area.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now if the radius is <i>r</i>, then the perimeter of the semicircle is π<i>r</i>.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
On the other hand, the base of the rectangular part will obviously be

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
2<i>r</i> because it shares that side with the diameter of the circle.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The area function is given by the area of the semicircle

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
plus the area of the rectangular portion,

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
so that’s the base of the rectangle and that’s the height of the rectangle.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay. Now we find the critical numbers, and you find there’s just one.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You check that in fact you have a negative second derivative,

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
so you have a local maximum, and in fact there’s just one of them,

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
so you have an absolute maximum at radius equal to 100/(4 + π).

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Here’s a plot which shows the same information.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That is the radius at which the area becomes maximum, and that’s the area.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay. On to number 4, which says that you have an open-top box

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
with a square bottom and rectangular sides,

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and the volume has to be 456 cm^3.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The question is to compute the dimensions of the box

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that will minimize the surface area.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you let the side length be <i>s</i> and the height be <i>h</i>,

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
then you have just one area for the bottom, <i>s</i>^2, and 4 of them for the sides—

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
after all, the box is open-top.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You still need to eliminate one of the variables, so you use the fact that

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the volume is equal to <i>s</i>^2<i>h</i>, and you solve for <i>h</i>.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You get get <i>h</i> in terms of <i>s</i>, and you replace that expression

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
to get a single function <i>s</i> for the surface area.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay. Now compute the critical numbers.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You find that it’s roughly 9.7.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Work out the second derivative,

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and you do have a local minimum at that critical number.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Once you’ve worked out the value of <i>s</i>,

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
then you work out the value of the height using the volume,

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and you find that the height is about 4.85.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The dimensions are 9.7 times 9.7 times 4.85.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay. On to number 5, which talks about a swimmer

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
who is at a point 400 meters

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
from the closest point on a straight shoreline.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This swimmer needs to reach a shop

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
which is located 200 meters downshore from the closest point.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The shop is here. Now the point is that he swims at 5 m/sec

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and walks at 6 m/sec.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The question is how far from the shop should he come ashore

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
so as to arrive at the shop in the least amount of time?

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Now obviously the Pythagorean theorem says that the third side over here

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is √(<i>x</i>^2 + 160,000) where <i>x</i> is the distance at which he lands on the shore.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The time function is equal to the first distance over here

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
divided by the corresponding speed

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
plus the second distance divided by the corresponding speed,

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
so that’s the time function for the problem.

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We compute the critical numbers, and we find there’s just one.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Work out the second derivative, and you find out it’s positive,

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
so in fact you have a local and absolute minimum at that critical number.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now you subtract off that value, and you find that

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the swimmer should come ashore roughly 597 m from the shop.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay. Number 6. Now we go into antiderivatives.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The question is find the general antiderivative of 4<i>x</i>^3 – 2<i>x</i>^2 + 7<i>x</i> + 1.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The answer is <i>x</i>^4 from there, from 4<i>x</i>^3, and then 2<i>x</i>^3/3 from the second term,

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
7<i>x</i>^2/2 from the third term, <i>x</i> from the fourth term

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and plus <i>C</i> for the constant in the antiderivative.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let’s check that. That’s correct.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If you plot the antiderivative, then of course there is a family of them,

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
so there are lots of curves over here, each of which is an antiderivative,

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and that’s the original function given to you.

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay. Number 7.

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The question is solve the differential equation <i>y</i>' = Sin[<i>x</i>]

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
given that <i>y</i>[0] = 3.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Now the antiderivative of Sin[<i>x</i>] is –Cos[<i>x</i>].

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
After all, if you compute the derivative, you get back Sin[<i>x</i>],

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and the plus <i>C</i> is just the arbitrary constant.

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Use the fact that the value of <i>y</i> at 0 is 3

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to find the value of <i>C</i>. <i>C</i> is 4.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The solution is <i>y</i> = –Cos[<i>x</i>] + 4.

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can check the answer with DSolveValue.

111
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Here is the equation.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That’s the initial value given to you, that’s the unknown function

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and that’s the independent variable.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
DSolve says that the answer is just the same

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
as the one that we obtained earlier on by hand,

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and here is a plot of the solution.

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It’s vertically shifted by 4 due to the 4 term over there.

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay. Number 8 talks about the velocity of a particle given in terms of <i>t</i>,

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and the question is to compute the position of the particle

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
at <i>t</i> = 10 given that the position at <i>t</i> = 1 is 5.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
As a first step, you work out the antiderivative.

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This term over here gives you –1/<i>t</i>,

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and the second term gives you –8<i>t</i>^(3/2)/3,

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and of course the plus <i>C</i> comes from the arbitrary constant.

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let’s check that.

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Looks correct.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Solve for <i>C</i> given the fact that when <i>t</i> is 1, the position is 5.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You find that <i>C</i> is 26/3.

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That’s the expression over here of the position function,

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
so its value at 10 is given right over here as an exact number.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Now let’s plot both the position and velocity function over here.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
On to number 9.

133
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You have a differential equation for <i>y</i>'' that’s given to be 4Cos[<i>x</i>],

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and you’re given the values of <i>y</i> at 0 and <i>y</i>' at 0.

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
For the first step, we find the antiderivative,

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and we find the answer is 4Sin[<i>x</i>] + <i>C</i>.

137
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Next find another antiderivative of 4Sin[<i>x</i>] + <i>C</i>,

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and you get –4Cos[<i>x</I>] + <i>Cx</i> + <i>D</i>.

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Check the answer.

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That looks correct.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Now having found the general antiderivative, you want to work out

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
what the values of <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are,

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
so you use the fact that <i>y</i>[0] = –1 and <i>y</i>'[0] = 1,

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
so that’s the equation over here.

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You know that <i>y</I>'[0] is 1 and <i>y</i>[0] is –1,

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
so you find that <i>C</i> is 1 and <i>D</i> is 3.

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You plug them back and you get –4Cos[<i>x</I>] + <i>x</i> + 3.

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Confirm the answer with DSolveValue, and here is a plot.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
In this case, because you have the term <i>x</i> over here,

150
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the graph gets translated upwards as you progress along the <i>x</i> axis.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Number 10.

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Once again you’re given <i>y</I>'' and you’re given <i>y</i> at 0

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and, in this case, <i>y</i> at 2.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The question is to solve this differential equation.

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Find the first antiderivative.

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You get back <i>x</i>^4/2 – <i>x</i>^2/2 + <i>C</i> from each term.

157
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Check the answer.

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Find another antiderivative, and this time you get <i>x</i>^5/10 – <i>x</I>^3/6 + <i>Cx</i> + <i>D</i>.

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Check that answer as well,

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and then you use the conditions given to you over here.

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
<i>y</I>[0] is 3—that’s the 3—

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and <i>y</I>[2] is 7—that’s the 7 at <i>x</i> = 2.

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Work out <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>.

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The solution for the problem is right over here.

165
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You can check that the answer is correct with DSolveValue.

166
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I did use an Expand over here to make sure it looks just the same,

167
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
but it is the exact same expression.

168
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You have 3 + (16<i>x</I>/15) – (<i>x</i>^3/6) + (<i>x</i>^5/10).

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Number 11, and now we are onto left-aligned rectangles.

170
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We are talking about Riemann sums.

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You want to estimate the area under this function from 4 to 7.

172
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because you have left-aligned rectangles,

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
so you have an <i>xi</i> – 1 over here—

174
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and of course, each rectangle has width 3/4

175
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
because the total length is 3  and you are using 4 rectangles.

176
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can compute the Riemann sum over here.

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Put in a numerical value.

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Here is a plot of the curve and the approximate area.

179
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Those white areas over here are

180
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the areas which get left uncovered by the Riemann sum.

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
On to number 12, which says compute the value of <i>b</i>

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
with <i>b</i> lying between 0 and π,

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
which will make the area under Cos[<i>x</I>] from 0 to <i>b</i> equal to 1.

184
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That’s the Riemann sum.

185
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Compute the limit as <i>n</i>→∞,

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
because that’s the actual area, and then you want to find out

187
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
when Sin[<i>b</i>] is equal to 1 between 0 and π,

188
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and of course the answer is just π/2.

189
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Here is a plot of the region which we just spoke about.

190
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Number 13 says use six right-aligned triangles to estimate the area

191
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
from 2 to 14 for this function over here.

192
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Now because you have 6 rectangles, the width of each rectangle is 2,

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
so you work out the Riemann sum.

194
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You go in steps of 2 starting from 2, and the 2 over here is

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the width of each rectangle.

196
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Compute the Riemann sum,

197
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and then here is a plot of the region and the rectangles.

198
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Number 14, which talks about a racecar which speeds up

199
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
in the first 10 seconds of a race.

200
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You have the first 10 seconds over here,

201
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
the speed in miles per hour over there, and the question is

202
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to find the lower and upper estimates

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
for the distance traveled by the racecar in the first 10 seconds.

204
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
To find the lower estimate, what you do is

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you start at the beginning of each 1-second interval in the computation.

206
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You have 0, 2.3, et cetera, and you times that by 1 second.

207
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The answer is 0.184.

208
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Then you do the same thing for the upper estimate,

209
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
but this time you take the right endpoints—2.3, 9.3, et cetera—

210
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and you get back 0.249.

211
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So the racecar traveled between 0.1845 and 0.249

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
in the first 10 seconds of the race.

213
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That’s roughly between 972 feet and 1,320 feet.

214
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That brings me to the end of this problem session.

215
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I hope you have had a better understanding of the topic

216
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
with these problems.

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
