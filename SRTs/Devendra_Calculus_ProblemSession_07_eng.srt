00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 7 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this session is integrals and the fundamental theorem.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with problem 1 for the session,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which says compute the integral of 5<i>x</i>^3 from –2 up to 3.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now the indefinite integral of 5<i>x</i>^3 is 5<i>x</i>^4/4 from the power rule,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and so you can use the fundamental theorem of calculus

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to simply plug in the upper and lower limits.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That’s the value from the upper and lower limits,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and you get the answer 325/4.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let’s check that with Integrate, and we do get the same result.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here is a plot of the region that we just integrated.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
On to problem number 2, which says here is a function

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and that’s the graph of the function.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The question is compute the integral of this function

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
from –5 all the way up to 3.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now the integral over here is the net area,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
so it’s the sum of the positives, and then you’ve got to subtract

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the negative areas where required.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There are four shapes over here.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
There’s a triangle on the left, and that’s got a base and height

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of 1 as you can see, so its area is 1/2.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You have a semicircle over here.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Its radius is 2, so its area is 2π.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There’s a quarter circle over there with radius 1,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so its area is π/4.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then there’s a trapezoid whose heights are 1 and 2

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and the base is 2, so the area is 3.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
When you do an algebraic sum, so you subtract off the negative area.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then the answer is 7/2 – 7π/4.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let’s compare that with Integrate,

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and we do get back just the same answer.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Number 3 says here is the velocity of a particle,

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and the question is find the displacement of this particle

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
in the time interval 1 to 4.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We first of all work out the displacement

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
as the integral of the velocity.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That’s <i>t</i>^4/2 – 7<i>t</i>^3/3 + 3Sin[<i>t</i>] + <i>C</i>.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
For example, this term over here gives you 3Sin[<i>t</i>].

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then you plug in the upper and the lower limits

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and work out the answer, which is right at the end of the line.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let’s check that the answer is correct through Integrate,

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and here is a plot of the velocity function on that time interval.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay. On to number 4, which says compute the integral of √16 – <i>x</i>^2

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
from –4 to 4, but this is just the area of a semicircle

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That’s the semicircle over here.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You have –4 to 4.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Of course if you work out the area, it’s just π<i>r</i>^2/2.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That’s 8π in this case.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let’s check the answer with Integrate,

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and you will get back the same result.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Number 5 says compute the integral of –Csc[<i>x</i>]Cot[<i>t</i>]

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
on the interval given over here.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now we first of all work out the indefinite integral,

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
which is just Csc[<i>x</I>] + <i>C</i>, of course.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Plug in the upper and lower limits.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Get an answer.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Check that the answer is correct with Integrate.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Here is a plot of the region for which we have integrated.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Number 6.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You’re given the marginal profit for a product,

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
so that’s the change in profit for a unit value of <i>x</I>,

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and you want to find the change in profit

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
when the sales increase from 64 all the way up to 81.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That’s just an integral like the one shown over here.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You first work out the indefinite integral,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
which is 50<i>x</i> – 3√<i>x</i>^(3/2), et cetera, and then you get the answer,

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and the answer turns out to be 416.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let’s check that with Integrate, and here is a plot

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
of the marginal profit and the region being integrated.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay. The next one says compute the integral given over here.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There’s an absolute value, so first of all,

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
let’s plot the function.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You see that the function has got three triangles.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There’s one here, one there.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
They are both going to have positive areas,

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and then there’s one negative area over here.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The first area is just 1.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The second one is 2—that’s this one.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The third one is 9, but you need to subtract the second area,

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and so the net area is just 8.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let’s check the answer with Integrate,

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and you do get back 8, so the answer correct.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Problem number 8 says compute the integral of Sin[<i>x</i>]^4Cos[<i>x</i>].

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now in this case, we do a little substitution.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We set <i>u</i> to be Sin[<i>x</i>], so <i>du</i> is Cos[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That’s this part over here, so the answer is simply Sin[<i>x</i>]^5/5 + <i>C</i>.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let’s check the answer through Integrate.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Remember that the <i>C</i> is set to 0 by Integrate.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There’s no <i>C</i> over here.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Here is a plot of the function and the indefinite integral.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
On to number 9, which says compute the integral given over here.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Obviously we need to put <i>x</i>^2 – 4 as <i>u</i>.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When you do that, then the <i>du</i>, the differential for <i>u</i>, is 2<i>xdx</i>,

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
so with a small adjustment, you get 3<i>xdx</i> = 3<i>du</i>/2.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You work out the indefinite integral over here.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now the point is you can either

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
work in the <i>u</i> picture or in the <i>x</i> picture.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you use the <i>u</i> limits, then when <i>x</i> is 3, then <i>u</i> is 5.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When <i>x</i> is 7, <i>u</i> is 45 because 49 – 4 is 45.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You plug in those limits and you get 130√5.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let’s check the answer in the <i>u</i> coordinates.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You could also work with the original <i>x</i> answer,

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and you get back just the same result.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Here is a plot of the region integrated.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay. On to number 10, which says compute <i>f</i>'[5]

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
where <i>f</i> is given by this integral over here, this integral function.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If you apply the fundamental theorem,

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
then <i>f</i>' will simply be the expression inside the integral

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
with the <i>t</i> replaced with <i>x</i>.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let’s check that.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then you plug in the value of 5 and you get back 376.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Here’s a plot of the integral function

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and its derivative on the given interval.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay. On to number 11,

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
which says you have a balloon which is losing air at a certain rate.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That rate is given over here.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You want to find the total change in air from <i>t</i> = 4 to <i>t</i> = 10.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That’s an integral over here.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We need to plot just to get an idea of what’s happening,

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and then you set <i>u</i> to be 35<i>t</i> + 10.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That’s the denominator over here.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So <i>du</i> = 35<i>dt</i>.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Make a small adjustment,

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and you work out the integral in the <i>u</i> picture.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Then you work out the change in air,

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and that turns out to be 1/360.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let’s check that with Integrate, and you get back the same result.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That’s a simple substitution

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to get the total change in air for this balloon.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
On to number 12,

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
which says compute the derivative of this integral.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Since you have a 4<i>x</i>^2 on top, you need to apply the chain rule.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The chain rule says that the answer is the integrand

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
with <i>t</i> replaced by <i>x</i> times 8<i>x</i>, which is the derivative of 4<i>x</i>^2.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Let’s check that with Integrate, and you get back the same result.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Then what you do is you plot the function over here,

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and that’s a beautiful plot of that answer.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay. Number 13, which says compute the integral over here.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now in this case, we set <i>u</i> to be 4 + <i>x</i>, so <i>du</i> is <i>dx</i>.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Now the <i>x</i> over here becomes <i>u</i> – 4.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We have (<i>u</i> – 4)√<i>u</i>.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You expand that, and you get <i>u</i>^3/2 – 4√<i>u</i>.

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Integrate further and then replace <i>u</i> with 4 + <i>x</i>,

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and so you get back an answer.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now Integrate gives a slightly different answer,

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
so let’s check that our answer is the same as the one from Integrate.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That’s the Integrate answer.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That’s our answer.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let’s check that they are the same by using Simplify,

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and you get back True, so everything seems fine over here.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let’s plot the function with Integrate over here,

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and you get back this nice plot.

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
On to number 14, the final problem for today.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The question is you’re given the graph of a function,

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
which is our semicircle over here and a straight line,

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and the question is to compute the linear approximation

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
of the integral of this function from 0 to <i>x</i> near 5.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Now when they say near 5, what they mean is

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
to compute the linear approximation at the point 5.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Remember you have a straight line approximation,

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
in this case, to compute.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You know that <i>x</i>0 is 5.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Work out the value of <i>y</i>0 from the integral,

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and if you do that from the integral, you see that you’ve got

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
this area over here and a triangle area over there,

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
so the total area is (2π + 9)/4.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Now what remains is to compute the slope,

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but the slope is just the derivative of the integral function at 5,

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
which is just the value of <i>f</i> at 5.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If you plug in the value of <i>f</i> at 5, which is right over here,

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
then you get back 3/2 or 1.5.

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That is the linear approximation, and if you plot it,

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
you see the linear approximation is really good near 5,

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
but not so good far away from it.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Linear approximations are very good approximations,

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
but they’re only good near the point at which you compute them.

178
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That brings me to the end of this problem session.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I hope you learned all the nice ideas

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
in this topic of integrals and the fundamental theorem.

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
