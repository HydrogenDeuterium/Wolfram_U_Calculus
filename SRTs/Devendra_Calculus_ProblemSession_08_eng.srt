00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 8 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this session is area between curves and volume.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The first few problems are about areas,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the next few problems are about volumes.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let’s begin with problem number 1,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which says compute the area between the curves <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
given by <i>x</i>^2 – 2 and <i>x</i>^3 + <i>x</i> + 7 between the limits –1 and 3 for <i>x</i>.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here is a plot of the functions,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and it’s clear that the orange line is above,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but that corresponds to <i>g</i>, so <I>g</I> is greater than <i>f</i> in the region.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The area would be the integral of <i>g</i> minus <i>f</i> from –1 to 3.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Simplify a bit, and that is the answer for the area.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Problem number 2 says find the area

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
enclosed by these two curves over here.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Again the functions are given to you,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but you’re not given the points of intersection,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so let’s find them with Solve.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Those are the intersection points.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Next you plot to get a geometrical picture,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and it’s clear now that the –<i>x</i>^2 – 2 is the one that’s dominating,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so <i>f</i> is greater than <i>g</i>, so you must do <i>f</i> minus <i>g</i> in the integral.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You do that for the given limits,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and then you get the answer for the integral.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Problem number 3 is the same kind of thing,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but now with <i>x</i> in terms of <i>y</i>.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You’ve got two functions of <i>y</i>, 2<I>y</i> + 4 and <i>y</i>^3 – <i>y</i>,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
between the limits –2 and 2.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You need to use ParametricPlot to get the correct picture,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and when you do that, it’s clear that <i>f</i> is greater than <i>g</i>

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
because <i>f</i> is to the right of <I>g</i>.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You work out <i>f</i> minus <i>g</i> between the limits,

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and here is the answer for the integral.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Problem number 4 is about two functions of <i>y</i>,

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but again this time you’re not given the points of intersection,

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so you want to find the area enclosed between them.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You use the Solve function to find where they intersect.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here is a parametric plot showing you what happens,

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and it’s clear that <i>g</i> this time is greater than <i>f</i>,

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
so you do <i>g</I> minus <i>f</i> and compute the integral,

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and you get back the answer for the area between those two curves.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Number 5. Now we’re on to volumes.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You’re given a solid with hexagonal cross sections,

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and you’re told that the area of those cross sections

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
is given by 6√3<i>x</i>^2.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The question is to find the volume of the solid from 0 to 5.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here’s a plot, but it doesn’t really matter what the details are;

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the main point is you have a formula for the volume

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
as the integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</I> of the area.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In this case, you have 0 to 5 of the area,

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and that’s easy to compute,

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so you get back the volume in this example.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
On to number 6, where you’re asked to find the volume

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
of this rather difficult-looking solid

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
which has a base which is a semicircle.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can see it over here.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You want to compute the volume for this solid

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
when the cross sections are equilateral triangles.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now that’s the difficult part.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How do you compute the area of each cross section?

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, the area for an equilateral triangle is <i>x</i>^2(√3/4),

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but <i>x</i> in this case is just the semicircle function over here,

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so the area is (36 – <i>x</i>^2)(√3/4).

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Work out the limits, but those are the limits

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
where the semicircle cuts the <I>x</i> axis, which are –6 and 6,

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
so that’s the area to compute.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Work it out and you get the required volume.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay. On to number 7, which says compute the volume of the solid

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
which is created when the region bounded by

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
this function and the <i>x</i> axis is revolved around the <i>x</i> axis.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That’s the plot of the solid, and the point over here is that

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you have a semicircle of radius 2, so the endpoints of the integral

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
will be –2 and 2 because that’s where

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the semicircle intersects the <i>x</i> axis.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now apply the disk method, so you chop the solid up into small disks,

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and each disk has the √(4 – <i>x</I>^2) as the radius, so it’s π<i>r</i>^2.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Work out the volume with the disk method, and that’s the answer.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now of course in this simple case, you have a ball with a radius 2,

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
so its volume is 4(<i>r</i>^3)π/3.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That’s just the same result that we got

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
a little while ago using Integrate.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
On to number 8, which says find the volume of the solid created

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
between this function over here

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and the <i>x</i> axis-bounded rotate from –π to π.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay. Again over here use the disk method.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When you use the disk method, you see that each cross section

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
has got radius (<i>x</i>Sin[<i>x</i>])^2,

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
so you work out the volume with the disk method in this case.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay. On to a similar kind of calculation, but now for <i>y</i> functions.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have a region that’s bounded by 2<i>y</I>^2 on the <i>y</i> axis,

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and you want to work out the volume of the solid from <i>y</i> = 1 to <i>y</i> = 3.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That’s the picture of the solid.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Apply the disk method, but this time the radius is 2<i>y</i>^2.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Use the formula for the disk method,

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and you get back the volume.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay. On to number 10, which says compute the volume of the solid

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
created when the region bounded by 2<i>x</i> and (<i>x</i>^2)/3

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
from <i>x</I> = 0 to <i>x</i> = 6 is revolved around the <i>x</i> axis.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Now there are two functions over here.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
When you plot over here, you see you’ve got a region

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
bounded by two functions,

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and that’s a good case to apply the washer method to.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We apply the washer method.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The outer radius is 2<i>x</i> from here.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The inner radius is (<i>x</i>^2)/3.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You simply apply a difference of the radii square over here,

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
so you get π times the outer radius squared

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
minus the inner radius squared and work out the volume

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
with the washer method.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
On to number 11, which talks about find the volume created

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
when the region bounded by (<i>y</i>^4)/8 and 2<i>y</i>^2 from those two limits

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
is revolved around the <i>y</i> axis.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Here’s a plot.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Once again, what you need to do is to apply the washer method

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because you’ve got two functions.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Apply the washer method, compute the volume

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
by doing π times the difference of the squares of the radii,

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and that gives the answer for the volume.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay. On to number 12, and that’s about computing the volume

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
of the solid created when the region bounded by this function

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and the <i>x</i> axis and the lines given over here

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
is revolved around the <i>y</i> axis.

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now the point here is the <i>y</i> axis,

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
so you need to apply the cylindrical shell method.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay. That’s the solid over here.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You break it up into small cylinders, and keep in mind that

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
for a cylinder method, you have to have 2π<i>rh</i>

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
where <i>h</i> is the function definition.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So you do that and you get the volume back,

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
but this time using the cylindrical shell method

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
because you are revolving around the <i>y</i> axis, not the <I>x</i> axis.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Number 13 says find the volume of the solid created

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
when the region bounded by this, the <i>y</i> axis

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and the two values given over here is revolved around the <i>x</i> axis.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Once again, that’s the plot, but apply the cylindrical shell method

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
because you have revolving around the <i>x</i> rather than the <i>y</i> axis.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You do 2π<i>rh</i> where <i>r</i> is <i>y</i> and <i>h</i> is the function expression.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Apply that and you get back the volume

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
using the cylindrical shell method.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Finally, on to number 14.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That says compute the volume of the solid created

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
when the region bounded by –<i>x</i>^2 + 2 and the <i>x</i> axis

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
is revolved around the line <i>y</i> = 4.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you think about it, we’ll apply the disk method,

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
but this time the radii will be obtained

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
by subtracting the function value from 4

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
because 4 is the line around which you are rotating, <i>y</i> = 4.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Then you work out the endpoints, get the integral over here.

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That’s π<i>r</i>^2<i>dx</i>.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Put in the limits, and you get back

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
the answer for the volume in the disk method.

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That brings me to the end of this problem session.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I hope you have learned these very important ideas,

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and I’ll see you next time.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you.
