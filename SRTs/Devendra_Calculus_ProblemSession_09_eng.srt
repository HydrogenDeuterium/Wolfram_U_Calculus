00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 9

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this session is numerical approximation of integrals,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
average value of a function, exponentials and logarithms.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let’s begin with the first problem on the session.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first problem says compute the derivative of 2<i>e</i>^<i>x</i>.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now the derivative of <i>e</I>^<i>x</i> is itself,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so the required derivative is 2<i>e</I>^<i>x</i>.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let’s confirm that with D.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Here is a plot of the derivative.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
On to number 2, which says compute the indefinite integral of 3^<i>x</i>.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The answer is simply 3^<i>x</i>/Log[3].

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let’s check that with Integrate.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That’s correct.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let’s plot both the function and integral, and of course

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
they just differ by a scale factor of Log[3].

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
On to number 3, which says compute the derivative of 2^<i>x</i>^2.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now that’s a bit harder and requires the chain rule.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You work out the as 2^<i>x</I>^2Log[2] times the derivative of <i>x</i>^2,

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
which is 2<i>x</i>.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can check that with D.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Notice there’s a 2^(1 + <i>x</i>^2) over here.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That’s where the extra 2 goes.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let’s plot the function and the derivative.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can see over here that the 2 occurs right over here.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay. On to number 4, which says

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
compute the integral from 0 to π/2 of Cos[<i>x</i>]<i>e</i>^Sin[<i>x</i>].

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You make a small substitution.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You let <i>u</i> = Sin[<i>x</i>].

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The <i>du</i> = Cos[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>, the derivative of Sin[<i>x</i>].

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then you get a very simple integral

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
because the limits become 0 to 1 when <i>x</I> is 0.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then Sin[<i>x</I>] is 0.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When <i>x</i> is π/2, Sin[<i>x</i>] is 1, so you get <i>e</i>^<i>u</i> from 0 to 1,

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which is—Integrate gives you <i>e</i> – 1.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let’s check the answer with Integrate,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and you get back the same answer.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now let’s plot the region being integrated,

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and that’s the required plot.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
On to number 5, which says compute the derivative of 4Log[3<i>x</i>].

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The answer is going to be 4 times the derivative of Log[3<i>x</i>],

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
which will be 1/3<i>x</i>, times 3 by the chain rule, so the answer is 4/<i>x</i>.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let’s confirm that with D, and you do get back 4/<i>x</i>.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Here is a plot of the function and its derivative.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
On to number 6, which says compute the integral

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
of <i>x</i>/(<i>x</i>^2 + 2) from –1 to 3.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Make a small substitution.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let <i>u</i> be <I>x</i>^2 + 2, so <i>du</i> is 2<i>xdx</i>, the derivative of <i>x</i>^2 + 2.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now when <i>x</i> is –1, then <i>u</i> is 3.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When <i>x</i> is 3, then 3^2 + 2 is 11, so <I>u</i> is 11.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You get back a much simpler integral which requires the Log function

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and the answer is 1/2Log[11/3].

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let’s check with Integrate, and you do get back the same answer.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Here is a plot of the region that we just integrated.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
On to number 7, which says find

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the derivative of Log[<i>x</i>] to the base 5.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, that’s just going to be 1/<i>x</i>Log[5]

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
because you can rewrite the input as Log[<i>x</i>]/Log[5].

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let’s check the answer with D,

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and here is a plot of the function and its derivative.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
On to number 8, which says compute the indefinite integral of Log[2<i>x</i>].

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, we need a small substitution.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let <i>u</i> be 2<i>x</i>, so <i>du</i> is 2<i>dx</i>.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Then you get the integral of Log[<i>u</i>]<i>du</i>/2.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Remember that the integral of Log[<i>u</i>] is <i>u</i>Log[<i>u</i>] – <i>u</i>,

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
so the answer is <i>x</i>Log[2<i>x</i>] – <i>x</i> + <i>C</i>.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Here’s the same answer from Integrate minus the constant <i>C</i>,

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and here is a plot of the function and its integral when <i>C</i> is 0.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
On to number 9, which says compute the average value

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
of the cubed root of <i>x</i> from 1 to 27.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now the average value formula is

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
1 over the upper limit minus the lower limit—

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that’s the length of the interval—

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
times the integral of the function over that integral.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Compute with Integrate and you get back 30/13,

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and here is a plot of the function

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and its average value on the same integral.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
On to number 10, which says find the point at which

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the average value of this function over a certain interval

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
equals the function value.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now that equals suggests that

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you want to apply the mean value theorem.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let’s do that.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We solve the equation function value at a point <i>c</i>

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
equal to the main value, and you get back that <i>c</i> is about 0.785.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Here is a plot of the function and its average value.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
On to number 11, which says compute the average value of <i>e</i>^(<i>x</i>/2)

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
over the interval 3 to 5.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That’s just a computation.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It’s 1/(5 – 3) times the integral of the function over the interval.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Here is the average value.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Then finally we have a plot of the function and the average value.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
On to number 12,  which says use the midpoint rule

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
with eight rectangles to compute the numerical approximation

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
for this integral over here.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
For the midpoint rule, you take the midpoints

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
as the points of the rectangles touch the curve,

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
so the width of each rectangle of course is just π/24

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
because you have eight rectangles, and you want the sample points

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to be the midpoints of each subinterval.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The sum is going to be the sum from 1 to 8

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
of the width of each rectangle

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
times the value of the function at the midpoint.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Compute it with Sum.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You get back 0.7895 approximately.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Check with NIntegrate, the built-in numerical integrator,

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and your values agree quite nicely because

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the midpoint rule is quite a powerful rule for approximation.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
On to number 13, which says use the trapezoidal rule

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to estimate the integral over here.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Now for the trapezoidal rule, of course you’ll take the height to be

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
just the width of these subintervals.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That’s (2π – <i>e</i>)/5 because you want five trapezoids.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Then you multiply that by the average, so to speak,

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
of the values at the two endpoints,

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and you get back the approximation.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In this case, the approximation is not very good

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
because the trapezoidal rule is typically not very accurate.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
On to number 14.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
How about Simpson’s rule?

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You want to apply Simpson’s rule with 10 subsections

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to compute the integral of Sin[Sin[<i>x</i>]] from 0 to π/2.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That’s a very difficult integral,

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but Simpson’s rule works really well over here.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The first step is you break up the integral into 10 subsections

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and you get π/20 for each of them as the length.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then apply the rule, which is basically you want to use

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
the rule 1, 4, 1—the values at f[2<i>i</i> – 2], f[2<i>i</i> – 1] and f[2<i>i</i>].

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Compute the approximation from Simpson’s rule,

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and it agrees quite well with the actual answer.

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That brings me to the end of this problem session.

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I hope you have learned a lot about average values

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and approximations and exponentials and logs by now.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
