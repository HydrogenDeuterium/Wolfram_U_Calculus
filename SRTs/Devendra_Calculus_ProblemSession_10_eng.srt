00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 10

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The topic for this session is L’Hospital’s rule

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and differential equations.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let’s begin with problem 1 for the session.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The question is find the limit of Sin[5<i>x</i>]/Sin[7<i>x</i>] as <i>x</i> approaches 0.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now if you simply plug in 0 over here, you get 0/0,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so that’s an indeterminate form,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which means you should try and apply L’Hospital’s rule.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You find the derivative of the numerator and denominator,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and you plug in <i>x</i> as 0.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You get back 5/7, which happens to be the correct answer in this case.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here is a plot of the function near 0

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that shows the limit value as well.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
On to number 2, which says find the limit as <i>x</i> approaches ∞

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
of <i>x</i>^2/Log[<i>x</i>].

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you again plug in ∞, you get ∞/∞.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That’s indeterminate, so you find the derivatives of the numerator

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and denominator and plug in ∞, and now you get ∞,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which is the correct answer, as seen from Limit.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Here’s a plot that shows that

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the function does approach ∞ as <i>x</i> approaches ∞.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
On to number 3, which says find the limit

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
as <i>x</i> approaches ∞ of √(2<i>x</i>)<i>e</i>^–<i>x</i>.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you plug in ∞, you get ∞ * 0 because <i>e</i>^–∞ is 0.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let’s rewrite that as √2<i>x</i>/<i>e</i>^<i>x</i>.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That’s the quotient.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then you find the derivatives of the numerator and denominator

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and plug in ∞, and you get back 0,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
which is the correct answer, as seen from Limit.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here’s the plot that shows what happens to the function

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
as you approach ∞.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
On to number 4, which says find the limit of 1/(<i>x</i> – Cot[<i>x</i>])

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
as <i>x</i> approaches 0 from the right.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now if you simply plug in 0, you get back ∞ – ∞.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
As we’ve done earlier in the lesson, we simply rewrite the expression

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
by taking a common denominator—<i>x</i>Sin[<i>x</i>] in this case—

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and you get back the expression over here.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then you work out the derivatives of the numerator and denominator,

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
but again there’s a problem because you get back 0/0 if you plug in

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
because you have 0 * Sin[0],

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and you have another 0 over there and a 0 over there.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So you apply L’Hospital again, and then you get back the answer 0,

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
which happens to be the correct limit in this case.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Here’s a plot of the function which shows the limit is indeed 0

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
as you approach 0 from the right.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay. On to number 5, which says find the limit of <i>x</i>^<i>x</i>^2

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
as <i>x</i> approaches 0 from the right.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you simply plug in 0, you get 0^0,

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
so that means you must take logarithms.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you do that, you get back <i>x</i>^2 * Log[<i>x</i>].

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Plug in 0 and you get 0 * –∞ because the logarithm of 0 is –∞.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But then you rewrite that as Log[<i>x</i>]/<i>x</i>^–2,

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and now you can apply L’Hospital.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You get back 0, but that’s 0 for Log[<i>y</i>],

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
so the limit itself must be 1.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can check the answer from Limit itself, and you get back 1.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Here is a plot of the function,

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
which clearly shows that it approaches 1  as you approach 0.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay. On to number 6, which says compute the limit

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
as <i>x</i> approaches 0 from the right-hand side of (1/<i>x</i>)^<i>x</i>.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you simply plug in 0, you get ∞^0, and so you apply logarithms.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You get <i>y</i> = (1/<i>x</i>)^<i>x</i>, giving you log(<i>y</i>) = log((1/<i>x</i>)^<i>x</i>).

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then apply the law of logarithms to get <i>x</i>Log[1/<i>x</i>].

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That’s –<i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>].

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now if you plug in 0, you get 0 * ∞ at 0.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You write the expression and then you plug in 0 again.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You get ∞/∞, so apply L’Hospital’s rule.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You get back 0, but that’s the value for log(<i>y</i>),

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
so the actual answer for the limit is 1.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You plug in that value, 1, and try Limit again, and you get back 1.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Here’s a plot around 0 which says

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
that the limit is indeed equal to 1.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay. On to number 7, which says find the limit as <i>x</i> approaches π/2

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
from the left of Sin[<i>x</i>]^Sec[<I>x</i>].

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now if you want to plug in π/2, you get 1^∞

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
because that’s 1 over here and ∞ over there, so apply a logarithm.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You get log(<i>y</i>) = log(sin^sec(<i>x</i>)(<i>x</i>)).

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That’s secant times Log[Sin[<i>x</i>]].

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Plug in ∞, π/2 and you get ∞ * 0.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Rewrite the expression as Log[Sin[<i>x</i>]]/Cos[<i>x</i>].

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Plug in π/2.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You get 0/0, so you can apply L’Hospital’s rule and you get back 0,

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
but that’s the limit for log(<i>y</i>), so the actual limit is 1.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You can confirm the answer with Limit, and you do get back 1.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Here’s a plot of the function around π/2,

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
which actually shows the limit is equal to 1.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
On to number 8, which says use Euler’s method,

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
the approximation method, with size 0.05

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to find the approximate solution

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
of this differential equation over here at 0.1 given that <i>y</i>[0] = 1.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That’s the right-hand side.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You want to find the value at 0.05 first

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
because you’re going in steps of 0.05,

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
so you start with the initial value plus the step size

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
times the initial value of <i>f</i>, and you get back 0.95.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Then you plug in 0.1.

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You start from the earlier value

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and you add 0.05 times <i>f</i>[0.05] times value,

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the earlier value, and you get back 0.899625.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
NDSolveValue, which is a much more accurate function,

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
gives you a slightly different value,

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
but we can see that the answer is still quite correct,

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and NDSolveValue simply improves the estimate by about 0.001.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
On to number 9, which says use Euler’s method with step size 0.05

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to find the value at 2.15

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
of this differential equation given that <i>y</i>[2] = 3.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That’s the right-hand side.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You first of all work out the value at 2.05.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You start with 3 plus the step size

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
times the value at 2 itself for the slope, and you get back 3.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Now start at this value over here,

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and then you get the next value at 2.1.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Repeat the same procedure, and you get the value at 2.15.

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You look at NDSolveValue and you get a pretty close answer,

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
which differs from it by around 0.033.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
On to number 10, which
 says

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
which of the following slope fields over here

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
is the field for <i>y</i>' = 2<i>x</i> – <i>y</i>?

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now what you do is you try and experiment at some points.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Suppose you have (0, 0).

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You plug back over there and get 0 – 0 is 0, so the slope should be 0.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But now if you look at B, the slope at (0, 0) is clearly positive,

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
so B is out.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
B cannot be the answer.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Then you go, let’s say, at (1, –1).

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Plug in the values, so you get 2 – (–1).

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That’s 3, so the slope should be positive.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But you see that for A at (1, –1), the slope is actually 0,

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
so A is out as well.

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Now go to (1, 0).

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The slope should again be positive, but if you look at D,

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
then at (1, 0)—that’s right over here—the slope is negative,

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
so D is out as well.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
B doesn’t work, A doesn’t work, D doesn’t work,

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
so the correct answer is C.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can actually check that with StreamPlot,

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and you do see that the correct answer is C.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
On to number 11, which says which of these, A, B, C or D,

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is the slope field for <i>y</i>' = <i>y</i>^2.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now if you plug in (0, 0), you get the answer 0 over here,

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
but at C, you see that there’s actually no slope

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
defined over here at (0, 0), so C is out.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
C could not be the right answer.

145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
For (1, 1), the slope would be positive again,

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
but if you look at D, at (1, 1)—that’s right over here—

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the slope is negative, so D is out.

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Then you look at (0, –1), another trial point.

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If you plug back over there, <i>y</i>^2 is positive.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The slope should be positive, but for A at (0, –1)—

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
so (0, –1) is here—the slope is actually negative,

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
so A is out as well.

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
C doesn’t work.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
D doesn’t work.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
A doesn’t work.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The correct answer is B,

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and you can confirm the answer with StreamPlot.

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The correct answer is B.

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You can see over here the match

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
between B over here and the StreamPlot over there.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
On to number 12,

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and now we’re talking about separable differential equations.

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Here’s a differential equation, <i>y</i>' = <i>x</i>^4<i>y</i>^2.

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You can separate it with two functions, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Then you rearrange, and you get back the equation over here.

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Integrate both the sides.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Now if you solve for <I>y</i>, you get –5/(<i>x</i>^5 + 5<i>C</i>),

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
but that’s just a constant,

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
so you can check the answer with DSolveValue,

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and you do get back the same result.

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
On to number 13, which says find the solution of <i>y</i>' = Sec[<i>x</i>]^2<i>y</i>

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
given that <i>y</i>[0] = 2.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Now you can separate this problem over here

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
because you have Sec[<i>x</i>]^2 over here times <i>y</i> over there.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You rearrange, integrate and then you solve for <i>y</i>,

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
so <i>y</i> = <i>Ce</i>^Tan[<i>x</i>].

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Plug in the initial conditions so when <i>x</i> is 0, <i>y</i> is given to be 2.

178
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That says that <i>C</i> is 2 from here, so the solution is <i>y</i> = <i>e</i>^Tan[<i>x</i>].

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can check the answer with DSolveValue,

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and you do get back the same result.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
On to number 14, which says find the solution of <i>y</i>' = <i>e</i>^(3<i>x</I> – <i>y</i>)

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
given that <i>y</i>[0] = 0.

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Now in this case, to separate, what you do is

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you break up the exponential into two parts as <i>e</i>^3<i>x</i> * <i>e</i>^–<i>y</i>.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You have two parts for the exponential.

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You’ve got <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and <i>g</i>[<i>y</i>].

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You can rearrange the equation like over here,

188
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and then you can integrate.

189
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You see over here that <i>y</i> must be log(<i>C</i> + (<i>e</i>^3<i>x</i>/3)).

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We still need to find <i>C</i>, but keep in mind that <i>y</i>[0] is 0,

191
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
so when you plug in those values,

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
you’ll find that C is equal to 2/3 because the logarithm of 1 is 0,

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
so <i>C</i> + 1/3 = 0, so <i>C</i> must be 2/3.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That’s the solution from hand calculation,

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and I can check the answer with DSolveValue,

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and you do get back just the same result.

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That brings me to the end of this problem session.

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Thank you very much.
